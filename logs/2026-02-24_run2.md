## Key Insights Captured

1. **Shin Splints**: Root cause is weak feet/collapsed arches - multiple treatment approaches documented
2. **Core Training**: Emphasis on stability/anti-rotation vs traditional ab work
3. **Neck Training**: Huberman's safe approach avoiding dangerous bridges
4. **Posture**: Multiple protocols for different postural issues
5. **VMO**: Critical for knee health, specific training methods

## Schema Status
- Using schema v0.1
- No schema changes required
- All new content fits existing structure

## Notes
- Large volume of prehab/rehab content added
- Strong focus on injury prevention
- Multiple approaches to same problems preserved (user choice)
- Ilia Topuria sprint protocol noted (12×100m)
- Gateway Tapes visualization technique documented

## Quality Metrics
- Consolidated 5 different shin splint approaches into one comprehensive protocol
- Preserved multiple posture correction methods
- Maintained safety warnings for neck training
- Clear progressions for complex movements (pistol squat)
