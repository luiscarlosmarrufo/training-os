## Content Categories Processed

### Injury Prevention/Rehab
- **Shin Splints:** Advanced single-leg force production, soleus training (8× bodyweight capacity)
- **Knee Pain:** IT band, medial knee, weekly rehabilitation protocols
- **Running Form:** Center of gravity corrections, midfoot landing

### Sport-Specific Training
- **Hyrox:** 100 unbroken wall balls protocol, farmers carry sprinting
- **MMA/Combat:** Lower body strength-power correlation, grip-specific training
- **Elite Athletes:** Topuria (12×100m sprints), Tsarukyan (bike conditioning)

### Running Protocols
- **Dynamic Warmup:** 12-exercise sequence, 5 minutes
- **Post-Run Recovery:** Quick and full stretching routines
- **Key Insight:** Stiff connective tissue increases running economy

### Posture Enhancements
- **Daily Quick Fixes:** Three 1-minute holds
- **Slouching Correction:** 5-minute routine
- **Multiple Approaches:** Band-based, foundation work, machine focus

## Key Insights Captured

1. **Force Production vs Absorption:** Core concept for shin splint prevention
2. **Soleus Importance:** Handles 8× bodyweight, critical for shock absorption
3. **Sport Specificity:** Machines acceptable for combat sports ("functional" not always better)
4. **Recovery Direction:** Massage gun always "toward the heart" for lymphatic drainage
5. **Elite Training:** Direct correlation between lower body strength and punching power
