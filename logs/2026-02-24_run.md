## Entities Extracted

### Total Counts
- Programs: 2
- Progressions: 6
- Exercises: 50+ identified (6 fully documented)
- Protocols: 6+ identified (3 fully documented)
- Rules: 3

## Deduplication Actions
- Mapped "Max" to rest-pause protocol
- Unified "SS" references as superset protocol
- Consolidated exercise aliases in aliases.md

## Schema Status
- Using initial schema v0.1
- No schema changes required for this content
- All entities fit within current structure

## Ambiguities Resolved
- "Max" protocol interpreted as rest-pause (20 sec rest between failure sets)
- Sprint progression weeks clearly delineated despite messy source
- Wave patterns distinguished between weekly waves and within-session waves

## Notes
- Initial KB population successful
- Many exercises referenced but not fully documented (can be expanded in future runs)
- Clean separation between programs maintained
- All exports ready for NotebookLM upload

## Next Steps
1. Upload exports to NotebookLM
2. Add additional exercise details as needed
3. Process new training dumps as they arrive
