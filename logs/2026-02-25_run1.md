# Processing Run Report - 2026-02-25

## Input File
- `inbox/2026-02-24_dump_3.md`

## Processing Summary
Successfully extracted and processed extensive training content focusing on arm development, boxing-specific training, hip mobility, foot strength, combat sports conditioning, and elite athlete observations.

## Entities Created/Updated

### Protocols (6 new)
1. **arm_training.md** - Science-based triceps/biceps/forearms protocol
2. **wrist_strengthening_boxing.md** - High-volume wrist conditioning for fighters
3. **hip_mobility_strengthening.md** - Comprehensive hip work with quick fixes and full workouts
4. **foot_ankle_strengthening.md** - Big toe control, arch rebuilding, barefoot essentials
5. **knee_pain_rehabilitation.md** (updated) - Added advanced rehabilitation exercises
6. **shin_splints_prevention.md** (updated) - Added advanced force production methods

### Routines (3 new)
1. **boxing_core.md** - "The Gauntlet" no-rest core circuit for body shot resistance
2. **combat_cardio_workouts.md** - 4 energy system protocols for fighters
3. **hyrox_leg_strength.md** - Competition-specific leg strength with single-leg focus

### Rules (2 new)
1. **boxing_strength_standards.md** - Minimum strength requirements before sport-specific work
2. **performance_enhancement_techniques.md** - Huberman protocols, bulletproof back goals, etc.

### Elite Athlete Observations (major update)
- **ilia_topuria.md** - Complete S&C program including:
  - Sprint protocol (12×100m)
  - Neck warmup technique
  - Power development exercises
  - Balance and proprioception work

## Schema Evolution
- No schema changes required
- Expanded controlled vocabulary usage: boxing, mma, combat_sports, hyrox
- All content fit within existing entity structure

## Deduplication Notes
- Consolidated multiple similar approaches into comprehensive protocols
- Maintained distinct variations where methodology differed significantly
- Cross-referenced with existing protocols (knee pain, shin splints)

## Export Updates
All NotebookLM exports updated:
- `02_protocols.md` - Added 6 new protocols (now 501 lines)
- `04_rules.md` - Added 2 new rules sections (now 484 lines)
- `06_routines.md` - Added 3 new routines (now 303 lines)

## Key Insights
1. Strong focus on sport-specific training (boxing/MMA/Hyrox)
2. Emphasis on unilateral leg work for athletic performance
3. Integration of recovery techniques into performance protocols
4. Elite athlete observations provide real-world validation
