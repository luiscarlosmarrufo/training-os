- heel walks 2x20-30 steps
- toe taps 2x20-30 steps
- pogo jumps 2x20-30 jumps
-

periostitis / shin splints,

- band resistance dorsiflexion raises
- standing anterior tibialis raises (thougher the further away from the wall)
- band resistance ankle inversion exercise THIS !! for rehab
- arch lifts (also called short foot exercise): mantain contact with all of the toes and heel, and just lift arch of the foot 
- quick symptom relief : stretch out the anterior tibialis muscle and tendon by going into plantar flexion (kneeling)and putting weight into the ankles (like going back)

learn pistol squat (explanation in spanish, but translate it to english):

- dorsiflexion arriba decaja como forzando un poco empujando
- contra la pared pegar totalmente el cuerpo incluido los talones, dar un paso hacia adelante las puntas mirando hacia afuera y pasando la alineacion un poco de los hombros, bajar con la espalda pegada a la pared, y poder bajar hasta abajo y luego subir, y no despegar talones

 pistol squat tutorial:


Easier than it looks stick with me and I'll show you how to master the squat in no time and trust me your legs will thank you for learning this start standing up stick one leg out in front of you and extend it by pointing your toes. Make your pew, pew, animation for weight distribution actively think about compressing your core and reaching out in front of you, as you go through the negative portion of the exercise. Keep your knees turned out just like a regular squat,push through your heels if you wanna start training for the pistol squad you should do step ups start with a small elevation and focus on the eccentric as you use the step I want you to slowly, but surely put your legs out in front of you once you can do 5 to 8 reps comfortably in each position, that's when its ok to advance forward next is eccentric slowly lower yourself 4 to 6 seconds on the decline, you can do this at the end of your workout then will add a chair block or something that you can stabilize ti hop back into the motion. I'm going to self title this as chair pistol squats as you can see using elevation everywhere letting my foot hang lower is going to allow me to gain mobility and strength and if you have problems compressing your core do these compact leg lifts, and if that's too difficult. You can alternate like I'm doing here.

andrew huberman: 

The best way to develop a strong neck safely as to unfortunately stay away from bridges . best thing to do is take a plate and start really light lie on a bench stabilize yourself by putting one arm down and then put that plate. Probably start with a five or 10 pound plate wrapped in a towel so you dont ended up with an imprint of the five or 10 on the side of your head and then you're just gonna go from neutral position which is your head you know it's actually straight up and down but you're lying on your side to just about 30 or 45°,  is important. Keep your tongue on the roof of your mouth, your jaw shut. Nasal breathe 10 to 25 repetition range 3 sets and then the other side rather than doing a lot of forward neck work you wanna lie on your stomach and put a plate on the back and get into that deck extension straight back but not pinching or wrenching your head back movements where you're creating some torsion up into the sides like this is a little more dangerous. I don't recommend and then the other thing and this looks ridiculous. Fighters know it's very useful that there's a kiss the sky thing where they'll actually look up and... you know and you'll feel in the deeper muscles of the neck

Posture:
1. Wall angels 10 reps
2. Lat stretch 30 sec
3. Leg hugs 30 sec
4. Cobra stretch 30 sec

posture therapist:

 as a posture therapist I seen neck humps all the time. The problem usually just isn't tightness. It's a loss of extension to the upper part of your spine at the base of your neck and can get worse as we age. Here's two simple moves to help restore that natural curve back into your cervical spine first (facing down but the head hanging) let your chin fall forward, then slowly pull it back and tuck it and finish looking up. Repeat this movement and focus on the extension through the base of your neck. This exercise helps the retrain those muscles to restore the natural curve in your spine, helping your posture overtime now pull your chin back and look left and right. Remember focus on slow and control movements and stop if you feel pain at any time do this consistently and you'll start to see improvement fast

 posture and donald duck butt fix:

 - use band or stick and doing overhand backs (shoulder dislocation ?)
 - Wall angels (engage core to keep lower back flat to the wall, and feet forward from the wall)
 - tight hip flexors: kneel down, engage core, and tilt pelvis back and lean forward to deepen the stretch
 - glute bridges and progress to single leg

-----

posture (from: squat university)

-in the floor looking down , forehead in the floor arms off the ground (not touching the floor) doing like an overhead press (thumbs up )and hold for 3 secs, 10 reps, progression is to add weight

progression:
- same pose but , like full circle angels idk how to explain it , not overhead press but the arms extendend at all times, palms face ground above shoulder  and flip the palms up as they get closer to the hips/glutes, reverse the sequence on the way back

document from the cia??? idk:
how to perform a lift at your max potential: basically close your eyes, inhale and think of the colour red, and the lift you are going to do, when you exhale open your eyes and do the lift (from colour breathing techniques from: Gateway Tapes)


---- 

look more masculine - build a strong neck

-neck curl (weight on forehead)
-neck extension (weight on back of the head)

1 or 2 sets per excercise but heavy ? few reps, because its delicate

---- 


realign neck:

chin tuck extensions - 10 slow reps (all the range of motion)
side -lying neck lifts 10 reps per side
gravity chin tucks 8-10 slow reps full rom
chin tuck with rotation 8-10 reos
"cats and dogs" (like in four and rounding the spine up and down) 8-10 reps

------

posture:

put a towel at the back of the neck and looking up laying down in the floor make small and controlled chin tucks, this guy doesnt do full rom, but he says this is the correct way , and you feel small muscles working and those are the correct ones for posture (idk)

5 tips to improve squats:

-neutral spine
-bring elbows to the front
- think of a lat pulldown to create upper back tightness
- think of "spread the floor", to activate glutes, important
- Brace your core in every single rep (so it doesnt feel weak and unstable)


-----

3 accesories for a stronger back squat (core)


- hanging knee raise (dumbell on feet), strong hip flexors -> controlled descent
- windshield wipers: loosen up our lower backs and work on obliques
- side black and raise leg up, obliques and work glute medius 


----

not train abs - train CORE

-lock clam 2x25 reps (feel the glute)
- front planks zero torso movement 2x30 sec , 
- side planks zero torso movement 2x 15 sec, 
- SHOULDER TAPS 20 reps
- glute bridge  (with band between knees ) 10x5 sec isometric ?


----

VMO muscle (up from the knee)
- sled work
- step ups with elevated heel (toe out and knee slightly to the inside)
- squat with knees elevated, slow mind muscle connection , and then high reps to lock connection and then add weight


-----

shin splints

comes from weak feet
1. arch builders to get feet moving 25 reps/side
2. isometric 5th ray holds for the lower leg muscles 20x3sec holds/side (like single leg glute bridges but with only toes (elevated heel))
3. tib turns to get the ankles rotating 30 reps /side
4. t tucks (toes) to stretch out the tissue on the top of the foor 60s/side


----

shin splints

from collapsed arches

- wall tibialis raises
- progress too : slanted wall tibialis raises (increased rom)
- progress too: single - leg seated kb or banded tib raises 

----

shin splints preventing / get rid 

20% of bw on tib bar for 20 reps
wobble board inversion/eversion

1-2 sessions per week


1. 3-4 sets of AMRAP tib bar tib raises 
2. 3-4 sets of AMRAP wobble inversion/eversion
3. 3-4 sets of AMRAP full range single leg calf raises, choosing favorite variation


-----


shin splints 4 sets of each


- single leg claf raises (you can go up with the two and come down with one slowly 4 secs descending) 10mreps each side
- lunge hold calf raises 10 reps on each side
- wall lean toe raises(tibs) further the harder, 15-20 reps
