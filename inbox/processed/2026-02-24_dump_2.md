shin splint rehab:

banded tib raises doesnt do much long term

its the ability to produce and absorb force on a single leg

recommended to to all this barefoot

- single leg weighted calf raises dont let the foot roll out (force on big toe i think), other leg up in a bench
- farmers carry but: TIPTOE walk, keeping pressure on the big toe, backwards too, and maybe some bent knee variation (side to side)
- bulgarians calf raise
- plyometrics: fast single leg bridge to wall (tiptoe all the time, floor and wall)
- plyometrics, single leg pogos (other leg resting high in a bench or something)
- stagger stance pogos (like boxing/muay thai guard)
- lateral hop ups
- tuck jumps

-----

shin splints occur when : force producing > force your lower leg can absorb

train to handle 15% bw on kb tib raises

train anke inversion and eversion with a cheal wobble board

get a string standing and seated calf raise

-----

get rid of shin splints forever

when running , the foot needs to land right below your center of grabity, if the heel striking happens much in front the center of gravity its more shock

- 3 sets to failure of tibialis raise (wall)
- ice , cold plunge too

------

shin splints 

- big toe pumps with resistance bands 20 of this twice
- enkle eversions (band) 20x2
- heel walks 40 steps in total
- stretch the shin out at the end
- calf strech
- foam roll

-----

periostitis / shin split

- wall tib raises (this variation puts a little ball in between the knees, )

pain on inside of knee (dont know the exercises names)

- "spider man crawl": floor prone hip internal rotation, laying face doen with knee bent 90 deg. moving the feet outwards
- "Single leg swiss ball hamstring curl": ball squeezse bridge , on your back with knees bent
- "sidelying adduction": but its like the same stnace as a dragon pistol squat and , obviosuly the body in the floor, and the extended leg (which is kinf of below the bent leg above), move the extended leg up and hold for a bit , firing the outside of the hip/leg/glute i think


-----

 if you have pain on the outside or inside of your knee or if your knees pop, crack, and snap, anytime you straighten or bend them here four exercises that will help you strengthen your knee and thus improve your pain. We're going to target your TFL when this muscle is weak, it's gonna cause pain on the outside of your knee. (Side lying TFL ABD) start by lying on your side, stacking your hips, and move that top leg slightly in front of your bottom one point your toe towards the ground and then lift your heel towards the ceiling, you should feel a sharp concentrated burn on the TFL on the outside of your hip. Next were connecting the TFL to the knee via the "pelvic Hitch" exercise. Think of this as updating your hip software so they can finally be compatible with your knees releaving pressure and reducing overall aches and pain lastly for knee pain or targeting the inner hamstrings and inner muscles, grab a foam roller and place it  between your thighs, now bridge up while simultaneously squeezing the foam roller, this is a buy one get one free exercise because you strengthening both your hamstrings and inner thighs at once eventually work your way up to the final boss of this exercise: the copenhagen plank

program lifting to get jacekd and strong for combat sports , science based approach

3 day full body or 4 day upper lower split

all muscle groups and movement patters 2-3 time a week

rep range for exerceises 4-8 (5- 10 also ok)

intensity : 0 - 1 RIR (reps in reserve)

total weekly volume per muscle group : 10-12 ish sets , (compund movemets can cover multiple muscles at a time)

rest period 3 minutes bare minimum, no intensifiers such as drop sets or rest pause

total session volume (effective sets ) is optimal around 12 total effective sets, order: most prioritized muscles going first

4-6 sets per muscle group per session is probably best  for two times a week and slightly less for 3 for higher frequency

4-6 sets @ x2 a week

~3 sets @ x3 a week

machines are just as okay , sometimes we get bombarded with a lot of functional bullshit
