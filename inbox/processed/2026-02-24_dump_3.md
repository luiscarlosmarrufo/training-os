build bigger arms:

triceps take 70 % of the arm , target the 3 heads, long head lateral head and medial head, 

lateral and medial head get targeted really easy, like in a dip,  close grip bench press, jm press, tricep pushdown

buut the long head takes the mayority of the size, the best way to target , maybe an overhead extension but preferidbly , with cable doing a tricep extension one arm, hold into something with the other hand , elbow stays inn place all the time, all sets to failure


biceps: long head and short head, you cannot target one or the other, they both get hid, but you can angle to a certain one depending on the exercise, rule of thumb: elbow behind torso - long head, elbow infront - short head.

so do both just in case

so do a cable curl with elbow behind torso and elbow stays in place all the time (bison cable curl i think its the name) 2 sets each arm for long head . for short head, single armb dumbell hammer preacher curl, dont use momentum as advantage, 1 set per arm 


brachialis: doesnt get hit much in the hammer curl, it gets more targeted in a reverse curl


the forarms: many muscles, but 3 main areass:
- forearm flexors: cable on top - wrist flexion
- forearm extensors: cable in bottom - wrist extenison (same but in reverse)

in this two exercises make sure that the elbow is in the same position the entire time
- brachial radialis: best hit in reverse curl, so you can do it instead of the hammer curls for hitting short head in the way, ACTUALLY BETTER than hammer 

volume:

- forearms: 2 - 3 times per week, they recover quickly, 2 sets per session for every exercise, more than enough to failure
  
- biceps and triceps twice a week, 2 sets per exercise, if its a unilateral 1 set, so in total per session 4 - 5 sets triceps 4 - 5 sets for the biceps, and whatever 4 - 5 sets for forearms

how strong is strong enough for boxing

stength for boxing:

minimums :
- bench 3 rep max 1 - 1.2x bw
- trap bar deadlift 3 rm: 1.85 - 2x bw
- max rep pull up 15 reps

once you hit this you can focus in other things like speed, power or even conditioning,


------

Wrist tutorial for strong punch: (in my opinion its a lont of volume but idk its just the video)

in a mat:
- palm lifts (on knees) 4x30sec rest 30 sec
- Closed fist deviation (radial and ulnar, but in the video it just does radial, but go a bit into the ulnar too), okay so like in knees and fists like a plank, and roll wrists to the front and back , like "hammer", 3x45 sec rest 30 sec
- hand hand fist fist 3x60 sec rest 45 sec
- grip trainer exerciser (the portable one you can adjust weight), heavy but just closing an open normal 4x20 rep 45 sec
- same one but holding 4x15sec 30 sec
- db wrist flexion (palms up) supported in something 4x20 rep rest 30 sec
- db isometric holds 4x30 sec rest 45 sec(palms down, extension ?)
- db wrist supination 4x20 sec rest 45 sec


------ 

explosive punching power ?

- band up (light ones that got a grip), punch down very explosively like ground and pound, knees a bit flexed
- hugging ball rotations with a band too (rotating very explosively)

------

flat feet :

GOOD exercise !!

front foot elevated split squat, with a weight on the opposite side of the foot forward that will help shift into this side (the side of the foot forward) and that elevation will help offload more of his weight onto his heel, so I was just going to do that hip shift into the side and then he's gonna come straight up and then he's gonna go straight down keep the contacts in his feet of his heel, the base of his big toe and his little toe

cardio workouts for improving gas tank (coach tarun)


1. max power (creatine phosphate system)

workout: 10 sec all0-out-sprint -> 50 sec rest 8-10 rounds

suggested modality: assault bike, assault runner

why: improves maximal output, and power endurance

2. anaerobic capacity (glycolytic system)

workout: 15 sec hard effort -> 45 sec rest, 6 rounds -> 3 min recovery -> repeat 3 or 4 times

suggested modality: assault bike, rower, ski erg

why: builds tolerance to lactate & improves anaerobic capacity

3. endurance engine (oxidative system)

workout: 2 min moderate pace - > 1 min easy recovery repeat for 20-30 mins

suggested modality: treadmill, rower, stationary bike, assault bike

why: enhances endurance and cardiovascular efficiency

4. HIIT / Tabata (high-intensity interval training)

workout: 20 sec max effort -> 10 sec rest 8-10 rounds

suggested modailty: sprints, assault bike, assault runner, ski erg

why: imporves vo_2 max & boosts metabolic conditioning


------------


fix knee pain while running:

- open up the hip joint (in the video it uses a banded pigeon pose hip mobilization)
-  kb weight shift (like kneeling down , but one leg is opened the and the weight is shifted to that leg)
-  side plank clamshell banded 10 reps 5 sec hold
-  


------ 

shin splints, reduce

- tib raises
- reverse sled pulls
- heel walks
- anke mobility banded, and rolling calfes with foam roller
- single leg balance exercise, just standing with one foow with two dumbells one on each arm


------------

strong feet (from a ultramarathon runner)

- hand-foot glove
- workout barefoot
- barefoot shoes

------

strong feet (movement by david)

- toe extension (hard progression is to sit on the feet with extended toes , )
- toe flexion (hardest progression is to walk on the flexes toes, like doing fists)

ankle flexibility with ankle eversions 30 secs at a time (so you do not get  affected by rolling an ankle)


--------


dorsiflexion

- foot on box ankle mobilization (with a band !!! around the front of your ankle) 15 reps
- wall tib raises
- try to actually drive the knee forward on leg days (try it on kb squat)
- 

--------

tight ankles

- set yourself up against the wall and stagger your feet, make sure both feet are facing forward, the idea is to bend that back knee as much as possible without the back heel coming up , easier when feet are closer together, more advanced when its further back (i liked a lot this one)
- (to be able to hold deep squat position) back against the wall , legs 90 degrees, holding hands in front of you and hold (same as wall sit i think), as legs get stronger, it helps with back while squatting

--------

knees over toes:

- loaded wall sits (kbs)
- supported split squats isometric holds
- bulgarian split squats
- single leg step downs
- heels elevated goblet squats

---------

arches:

- towel toe curls 3x20 reps per side
- foot lace ankle circles (fingers laced with toes ) 3x10 each direction per side
- grounded ankle rocks , to restore dorsiflexion 3x10

----

foot and ankle strength:

- heel walking, maaintain dorsiflexion
- bent leg heel walking
- walk inverted : walk with the edges of the feet
- now evert: walk with the inner part
- towel toe curls

------


you need to be able do lift your big toe only big toe (and the mind muscle connection needs to be there), also keeping the big toe in the ground and lift the other ones one by one and descensing one by one (like wave) its very important in balance, knee alignment hips glutes etc

- hold big toe up in wall stretch (wall corner so that the other toes are on the ground) 1-2 min
- same stance, press big toe into the wall or floor as hard as you can hold for 15 sec, separate and try lifting all your toes a few times, go between this two exercises a few times

------

while performing lower body exercises in the gym , keep in mind the 3 points of contact of the foot, try using minimal barefoot footware like vivo, 

-----

for flat feet:

big toe extensions with band , find the balance point  where your ankle is not rolling out, with flat feet the ankle tends to go inward so try to balance this
