Below is your **SW7 Academy** routine typed up cleanly and organized. I also reconstructed the **weekly progression logic** the way it most clearly makes sense from your notes.

---

## SW7 Academy — Weekly Layout (7 days)

* **Day 1:** FBB Lower (Strength focus)
* **Day 2:** FBB Push (Strength + Capacity)
* **Day 3:** FBB Pull + Core
* **Day 4:** Rest
* **Day 5:** FBB Full Body (Strength + Engine)
* **Day 6:** VO₂ Max Intervals (Running)
* **Day 7:** Rest

---

# Progression System (the “implied weekly progression”)

Your notes repeat the same pattern next to the **main strength lift** on Days 1–3:

### Main Lift 4-Week Wave (applies to Back Squat / Bench Press / Weighted Chin)

**Week 1:** 4×6 @ **75%**
**Week 2:** 4×5 @ **77%**
**Week 3:** 5×5 @ **80%**
**Week 4:** 5×4 @ **85%**

**How to run it**

* Use the same lift for 4 weeks, follow the wave above.
* After Week 4, either:

  * restart the wave slightly heavier (preferred), or
  * deload 1 week, then restart.

---

# DAY 1 — FBB Lower (Strength)

## 1) Warmup / Prehab

Do as a simple flow (in order):

1. **Squat to Stand** — 2×10
2. **BW Single-Leg Glute Bridge** — 2×8 (each side)
3. **Long Lever Lunge + Twisted Lizard** — 2×6 (each side)

> Your paper labels this area as a “circuit”, so you can run these as **2 rounds** continuously.

---

* **Lateral Plank Dips** — 10 reps **each side**

(Your note says “each side” next to this section — the plank dips are definitely per side; you can also do toe taps as total reps unless you specifically mean per side.)

---

---

# DAY 6 — VO₂ Max Intervals (Running)

## 1) Movement Prep

* **Rocking Adductor** — 2×10 each side
* **Single-Leg Glute Bridge off Bench** — 2×10 each side
* **DB Forward Lunge** — 2 sets (your reps are written as “2×? ES”; the clean, logical match is **2×8 each side**)
* **Hip Flexor Stretch w/ Rotation** — 2×10 each side

## 2) Warm-Up Jog

* **Run** — 800 m easy

## 3) Working Set

* **Run: 5 × 4 minutes** at **tempo / VO₂ effort**

Your sheet doesn’t show rest intervals, so the clean standard implementation is:

* **Rest 2:00 easy jog/walk** between reps
  (If you meant a different rest, this is the one that fits VO₂/tempo structure best.)

---

# SECOND PROGRAM

## Dylan Shannon :


Yes — I re-scanned the *whole* Day 1 page, and your interpretation is basically correct. Here’s the **clean “true Day 1”** with the **exact switches + progressions**, and I’ll call out the couple spots that are genuinely messy/ambiguous.

---

# Day 1 (Sprint / Jumps / Heavy) — **TRUE VERSION (from the whole page)**

## Global rule (written top right)

**“Max” = failure → rest 20 sec → do as many reps as possible** (rest-pause).

Also: **anything marked “SS” = superset.**

---

## A) Conditioning circuit — Dynamic warmup (yardage)

**(Run like a circuit)**

* Hamstring scoops — **x10 yds**
* Quad pull w/ reach — **x10 yds**
* Reverse lunge w/ reach — **x10 yds**
* High kicks — **x10 yds**
* Knee hug → FWD lunge — **x10 yds**
* Single-leg RDL (walk) — **x10 yds**

Then:

* Single switches — **2×10 yds**
* Double switches — **2×10 yds**
* Triple switches — **2×10 yds**
* Straight-leg bounds — **3×20 yds**

---

## B) Strength / Power

### 1) **Sprints (the real progression is at the bottom of the page)**

**Rest rule:** *yards ÷ 10 = minutes rest* (15→1.5m, 20→2m, 30→3m, 40→4m)

**Week 1:** 3×10, 3×15, 4×20
**Week 2:** 5×15, 5×20
**Week 3:** 3×15, 4×20, 2×30
**Week 4:** 3×15, 3×20, 3×30
**Week 5:** 4×20, 4×30
**Week 6:** 4×20, 5×30
**Week 7:** 8×30
**Week 8:** 6×40

✅ This matches exactly the bottom “Sprints” row with the week-by-week boxes.

---

### 2) Jumps

* Seated vertical jump — **3×3**
* Seated broad jump — **3×3**

---

### 3) Olympic lift progression — **you were right about the switch**

This is written mid-page + clarified at the very bottom.

#### **Weeks 1–4**

* **Block Clean — 4×3** *(you literally wrote: “for the first 4 weeks”)*

#### **Weeks 5–8**

Then you wrote at the bottom:

> “First 4 weeks then **cleans**. Up the weight as goes down in reps: **3,3,2,2,1** (for 4 weeks)”

So clean execution:

* **Clean wave:** **3 / 3 / 2 / 2 / 1**

  * increase weight each step
  * focus on speed + crisp reps
  * (this is a *wave*, not 5 straight sets at same weight)

✅ That is exactly the “3,3,2,2,1 up the weight down in reps” note you referenced.

---

### 4) Back squat progression — yes, and it includes the “8 8 7 6” you mentioned

There are **two different rep patterns** on the page:

#### **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): straight sets**

You wrote:

* **W1:** 4×8 @ 70–75
* **W2:** 4×7 *(heavier; 77.5–82.5-ish is written)*
* **W3:** 5×6 @ 80–85
* **W4:** 5×5 @ 80–85

✅ This is the clean “4×8, 4×7, 5×6, 5×5” line.

#### **The “8 8 7 6” you’re remembering**

That “8–8–7–6” appears on the page as an extra rep drop pattern (it’s written near the strength section). The clean way it fits the program is:

* It’s essentially the **rep drop logic** you apply across the first block (i.e., “start with 8s, then 7, then 6”), and it matches the Week 1–3/4 movement.
  So: you didn’t imagine it — it’s just not a separate *third* squat plan; it reinforces the same rep trend.

#### **Phase 2 (Weeks 5–6): potentiation waves**

You wrote the wave:

* **(6,4,2) then (6,4,2)** @ 80–85
* and “increase weight” / “heavier”

So:

* **W5:** 6-4-2 / 6-4-2 (build within the session)
* **W6:** same, but heavier

#### **Phase 3 (Weeks 7–8): heavier waves**

You wrote:

* **(5,3,1) / (5,3,1)** @ 85–95
* heavier

So:

* **W7:** 5-3-1 / 5-3-1
* **W8:** same, heavier

✅ So yes: the squat is **4-week straight build → 2 weeks 6-4-2 waves → 2 weeks 5-3-1 waves**.

---

## Accessories — and yes, the last 2 weeks swap is real

### Weeks 1–6 (Accessory SS)

Mid-page you have:

* **DB Bulgarian split squat — x reps**
* **Glute-ham raises — x reps**
  …and it’s marked **SS** with “×3” (3 supersets).

At the bottom you clarify the progression:

**DB Bulgarian SS** progression reads like:

* 3×8 → 3×8 → 3×7 → 3×6 → 3×6 → 3×5
  (then it stops because you swap in the last 2 weeks)

**Glute-ham raise** line includes “**3 second lower**” and trends similarly, with “Max” showing up later (meaning rest-pause rule may apply).

So clean version:

### **Weeks 1–6: Superset ×3**

* DB Bulgarian split squat — follow weekly reps: **8, 8, 7, 6, 6, 5**
* Glute-ham raise (3-sec eccentric) — same rep trend (push to “Max” if written)

Rest: 60–120 sec between rounds.

---

### Weeks 7–8 (Last 2 weeks swap — you were right)

On the right, circled: **“last 2 weeks”** and under it:

* **Goblet lats — 8 reps**
* **Single leg calf raise — 10 reps** *(this is what it looks like in the circle)*
  …and it’s also marked like a **3-set superset**.

So:

### **Weeks 7–8: Superset ×3 (swap in)**

* Goblet lateral split squat (“goblet lats”) — **8 reps**
* Single-leg calf raise — **10 reps**

✅ This matches your memory: those replace the Bulgarians + GHR in the last 2 weeks.

---

# Summary: what you thought vs what’s actually on the page

* ✅ **Block cleans (4×3) for first 4 weeks** → then **cleans wave 3,3,2,2,1** for next 4 weeks (increase weight as reps drop).
* ✅ **DB Bulgarians + GHR are a 3-set superset** (marked SS), and the rep trend includes **8-8-7-6**.
* ✅ **Last 2 weeks swap**: Bulgarians+GHR get replaced by **Goblet lateral split squat + single-leg calf raise** as a **3-set superset**.
* ✅ Back squat is the 4-week straight build + 6-4-2 waves + 5-3-1 waves.
