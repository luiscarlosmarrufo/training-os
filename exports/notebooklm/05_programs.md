## Dylan Shannon Sprint/Jump/Heavy Program
**Duration:** 8 weeks
**Focus:** Speed, Power, Strength
**Structure:** Progressive overload across all qualities

### Global Programming Rules
- "Max" = rest-pause protocol (failure → 20 sec rest → continue)
- "SS" = superset
- Sprint rest = yards ÷ 10 = minutes

### Day 1 Structure - Sprint/Jump/Heavy

**A) Dynamic Warmup Circuit**

*Movement Prep (10 yards each):*
1. Hamstring scoops
2. Quad pull w/ reach
3. Reverse lunge w/ reach
4. High kicks
5. Knee hug → Forward lunge
6. Single-leg RDL (walk)

*Activation:*
- Single switches - 2×10 yds
- Double switches - 2×10 yds
- Triple switches - 2×10 yds
- Straight-leg bounds - 3×20 yds

## Key Programming Concepts

### Progressive Overload Methods
1. **Linear:** Add weight weekly
2. **Wave:** Vary load/reps in cycles
3. **Volume:** Increase sets/reps
4. **Density:** Reduce rest periods
5. **Frequency:** Add training days

### Recovery Requirements
- 48-72 hours between same muscle groups
- 2 full rest days per week minimum
- Deload every 4-6 weeks
- Sleep 7-9 hours for optimal recovery

### Exercise Selection Hierarchy
1. Main compound movements (squat, bench, deadlift)
2. Accessory compounds (rows, presses, pulls)
3. Isolation work (curls, raises, extensions)
4. Conditioning/metabolic work

### Intensity Distribution
- 70% of work at moderate intensity (70-85%)
- 20% at high intensity (85-95%)
- 10% at low intensity/recovery (40-70%)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Progressing too quickly
- Ignoring recovery needs
- Poor exercise execution
- Inconsistent training
- Not tracking progress
- Skipping warm-ups
- Ego lifting

## Program Customization Guidelines

### For Strength Focus
- Increase intensity (85-95%)
- Reduce reps (1-5)
- Longer rest (3-5 min)
- More frequency on main lifts

### For Hypertrophy Focus
- Moderate intensity (65-85%)
- Higher reps (8-15)
- Shorter rest (60-120 sec)
- More volume per muscle

### For Endurance Focus
- Lower intensity (40-65%)
- High reps (15+)
- Minimal rest (30-60 sec)
- Circuit training format

### For Power Development
- Explosive movements first
- Lower volume (3-5 reps)
- Full recovery between sets
- Focus on bar speed/velocity
