## Olympic Lift Progression
**Block Clean to Full Clean transition**

### Phase 1: Technical Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- **Block Clean:** 4×3
- Focus on positions and technique

## Seated OHP Weekly Volume Progression
**Progressive volume accumulation**

### Structure
- **Week 1:** 3×8
- **Week 2:** 4×8
- **Week 3:** 4×10
- **Week 4:** 4×12

### Implementation
- Choose weight that allows clean reps throughout
- Small weight increases if form remains perfect
- Focus on strict form over load
- After week 4: restart with 5-10 lbs heavier

### Rationale
- Builds work capacity
- Improves muscular endurance
- Develops pressing stability
- Volume-based hypertrophy stimulus

## Bulgarian Split Squat 6-Week Progression
**Rep reduction for progressive loading**

### Structure
- **Week 1:** 3×8
- **Week 2:** 3×8 (same or slightly heavier)
- **Week 3:** 3×7
- **Week 4:** 3×6
- **Week 5:** 3×6 (heavier than week 4)
- **Week 6:** 3×5

### Implementation
- Performed as superset with glute-ham raises
- Use dumbbells for loading
- Increase weight when reps decrease
- Rest 60-120 seconds between supersets

### Key Points
- Two weeks at 8 and 6 reps for adaptation
- Progressive overload through load increases
- Builds unilateral strength and stability

## General Progression Principles

### Linear Progression
- Add weight each week
- Suitable for beginners
- Simple and effective
- Stop when form breaks or missed reps

### Wave Loading
- Vary intensity within session
- Better for advanced lifters
- Allows heavier loading
- Potentiates nervous system

### Block Periodization
- Focus on one quality per block
- Volume → Intensity → Peaking
- 3-4 week blocks typical
- Prevents accommodation

### Autoregulation
- Adjust based on daily performance
- RPE/RIR based loading
- Accounts for life stress
- Requires experience to implement

## When to Progress

### Indicators for Progression
- All prescribed reps completed with good form
- Recovery between sessions is adequate
- No joint pain or discomfort
- RPE is lower than target

### When to Maintain or Deload
- Missed reps in 2+ sessions
- Technique deterioration
- Poor recovery or sleep
- Life stress is high
- Every 4-6 weeks preventatively
