# Training OS - Training Rules & Principles

## Sprint Rest Formula
**Category:** Recovery
**Applies to:** All sprint training

### The Rule
**Rest time (minutes) = Sprint distance (yards) ÷ 10**

### Application
- 10 yards = 1.0 minute rest
- 15 yards = 1.5 minutes rest
- 20 yards = 2.0 minutes rest
- 30 yards = 3.0 minutes rest
- 40 yards = 4.0 minutes rest

### Rationale
- Ensures adequate phosphocreatine replenishment
- Maintains sprint quality across all repetitions
- Prevents excessive fatigue accumulation
- Allows consistent power output throughout session

### Implementation Notes
- Use timer for accuracy
- Complete rest (no active recovery)
- If quality drops, add 30 seconds to formula
- For beginners, can multiply by 1.5

## Best Exercises for Raw Strength
**Category:** Exercise Selection
**Purpose:** Maximizing absolute strength development

### The Top 5
1. **Back Squat**
   - Lower body strength foundation
   - Full kinetic chain involvement
   - Highest loading potential for legs

2. **Bench Press**
   - Upper body pushing strength
   - Allows progressive overload for decades
   - Benchmark strength standard

3. **Chins/Pull-Ups**
   - Upper body pulling strength
   - Relative strength indicator
   - Can be loaded progressively

4. **Farmer's Carry**
   - Total body strength and stability
   - Grip strength developer
   - Core and postural strength

5. **Bulgarian Split Squat**
   - Unilateral lower body strength
   - Addresses imbalances
   - Lower spinal load than bilateral work

### Programming Principles
- Focus on progressive overload
- Use 1-6 rep range primarily
- Allow 48-72 hours recovery
- Prioritize these in program design
- Track progress meticulously

## Best Exercises for Muscle Growth
**Category:** Exercise Selection
**Purpose:** Maximizing hypertrophy

### Lower Body Selections
1. **Squat** - Quad and glute mass
2. **Bulgarian Split Squat** - Unilateral development
3. **Barbell Hip Thrust** - Glute isolation
4. **Sled Push** - Quad volume without eccentric damage

### Upper Body Push
5. **Dumbbell Bench Press** - Chest with greater ROM
6. **Dumbbell Shoulder Press** - Deltoid mass
7. **Plate Press-Up** - Chest finisher and pump

### Upper Body Pull
8. **Chin/Pull-Ups** - Lat width and bicep mass
9. **Single-Arm Dumbbell Row** - Unilateral back thickness
10. **Prone Pull** - Mid-back development

### Hypertrophy Principles
- Use variety of rep ranges (6-15)
- Focus on time under tension
- Control eccentric portion (2-3 seconds)
- Progress volume before intensity
- Use full range of motion
- Create metabolic stress
- Focus on mind-muscle connection

## Recovery Guidelines
**Category:** Programming
**Purpose:** Optimizing adaptation

### Between Sessions
- **Same muscle group:** 48-72 hours
- **Neural intensive work:** 72 hours minimum
- **Metabolic work:** 24-48 hours
- **Technical practice:** Can be daily if submaximal

### Within Sessions
- **Strength sets (1-5 reps):** 3-5 minutes
- **Hypertrophy sets (6-12 reps):** 60-120 seconds
- **Endurance sets (12+ reps):** 30-60 seconds
- **Power/Olympic lifts:** 2-4 minutes

### Weekly Structure
- **2 rest days minimum** for most programs
- **Active recovery** preferred over complete rest
- **Deload every 4-6 weeks** preventatively
- **Listen to body** - extra rest when needed

---

## Exercise Order Principles
**Category:** Programming
**Purpose:** Optimizing performance and safety

### Priority System
1. **Explosive/Power** (Olympic lifts, jumps, sprints)
2. **Multi-joint Strength** (squats, deadlifts, presses)
3. **Single-joint Strength** (rows, pulls)
4. **Assistance Work** (isolation exercises)
5. **Metabolic/Conditioning** (circuits, intervals)

### Exceptions
- Pre-exhaust protocols
- Weak point priority training
- Metabolic emphasis phases
- Technical practice can be first

## Volume Landmarks
**Category:** Programming
**Purpose:** Appropriate dosing

### Per Session
- **Beginners:** 10-12 working sets
- **Intermediate:** 15-20 working sets
- **Advanced:** 20-25 working sets

### Per Week Per Muscle
- **Minimum Effective:** 8-10 sets
- **Optimal for Most:** 12-18 sets
- **Maximum Adaptive:** 20-25 sets
- **Maintenance:** 4-6 sets

### Signs of Excessive Volume
- Performance decrease
- Joint discomfort
- Poor recovery
- Motivation loss
- Sleep disruption

---

## Intensity Zones
**Category:** Loading
**Purpose:** Appropriate stimulus selection

### Strength Focus
- **Intensity:** 85-100% 1RM
- **Reps:** 1-5
- **Sets:** 3-6
- **Rest:** 3-5 minutes

### Hypertrophy Focus
- **Intensity:** 65-85% 1RM
- **Reps:** 6-12
- **Sets:** 3-4
- **Rest:** 60-120 seconds

### Endurance Focus
- **Intensity:** 40-65% 1RM
- **Reps:** 15+
- **Sets:** 2-3
- **Rest:** 30-60 seconds

---

## Form Standards
**Category:** Technique
**Purpose:** Safety and effectiveness

### Non-Negotiables
- Full range of motion unless injured
- Control throughout entire rep
- No momentum except where prescribed
- Breathing pattern maintained
- Neutral spine on all applicable lifts

### When to Terminate Set
- Form breakdown
- Sharp pain
- Significant speed loss (power work)
- Unable to maintain tempo
- Spotter assistance required

---

## Progression Triggers
**Category:** Programming
**Purpose:** When to advance

### Add Weight When:
- All reps completed with perfect form
- RPE is 1-2 points below target
- Recovery is complete between sessions
- Technique feels automatic

### Maintain or Reduce When:
- Missing reps consistently
- Form deteriorating
- Joint discomfort present
- Life stress is high
- Sleep under 6 hours for multiple nights

---

## Training Age Considerations
**Category:** Programming
**Purpose:** Age-appropriate modifications

### Beginners (0-1 year)
- Linear progression
- Full body 3x/week
- Master technique first
- 8-12 rep range primarily

### Intermediate (1-3 years)
- Upper/Lower or Push/Pull/Legs
- 4-5x/week training
- Periodized approach
- Mix of rep ranges

### Advanced (3+ years)
- Specialized programs
- 5-6x/week possible
- Advanced techniques (clusters, waves)
- Careful volume management

## 5 Tips to Improve Squats
**Category:** Technique
**Purpose:** Optimizing squat performance and safety

### The 5 Key Cues
1. **Neutral Spine** - Maintain natural curves, no excessive arching/rounding
2. **Elbows to Front** - Creates upper back tightness and better bar position
3. **Think "Lat Pulldown"** - Pull bar into traps for stability
4. **Think "Spread the Floor"** - External rotation cue for glute activation
5. **Brace Core Every Rep** - Prevents instability and protects spine

### Implementation
- Practice each cue individually first
- Combine gradually with lighter weights
- Film yourself to check form
- Reset between reps if needed

### Why These Work
- Neutral spine: Force transfer and injury prevention
- Elbows front: Upper back stability
- Lat pulldown: Creates stable shelf for bar
- Spread floor: Glute activation and knee tracking
- Core bracing: Power transfer and spinal protection

## Max Lift Visualization Technique
**Category:** Performance
**Purpose:** Optimizing nervous system for maximum efforts

### The Protocol
1. **Close your eyes** before approaching bar
2. **Deep inhale** while visualizing
3. **Visualize RED color** filling your vision
4. **See yourself** completing the lift perfectly
5. **Exhale and open eyes**
6. **Immediately execute** the lift

### When to Use
- 1RM attempts
- Competition lifts
- PR attempts
- Final heavy sets
- Any true maximal effort

### Rationale
- Red color associated with power and sympathetic activation
- Visualization primes motor patterns
- Breathing regulates nervous system
- Creates consistent pre-lift routine
- Based on Gateway Tapes/color breathing techniques

### Common Mistakes
- Taking too long (loses activation)
- Shallow breathing
- Vague visualization
- Using for every set (save for max efforts)
