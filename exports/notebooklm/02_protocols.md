# Training OS - Protocols Library

## Rest-Pause Protocol
**Aliases:** Max, Rest-Pause, Cluster

### Overview
Intensity technique for breaking through plateaus and maximizing muscle fiber recruitment.

### Implementation
1. Perform reps to failure
2. Rest exactly 20 seconds
3. Perform as many additional reps as possible
4. Optional: Repeat for additional mini-sets

### Best Practices
- Use on accessory movements, not main lifts
- Maintain strict form even when fatigued
- Stop if form deteriorates significantly
- Keep rest periods precise (20 seconds)

### Common Applications
- Final set intensification
- Breaking plateaus
- Time-efficient training
- Accessory work enhancement

## Superset Protocol
**Aliases:** SS, Super Set

### Overview
Pairing two exercises performed back-to-back with minimal rest between.

### Types
- **Antagonist Superset:** Opposing muscle groups (biceps/triceps)
- **Agonist Superset:** Same muscle group (pre-exhaust technique)
- **Non-competing Superset:** Different muscle groups (legs/shoulders)

### Implementation
1. Complete first exercise for prescribed reps
2. Immediately transition to second exercise
3. Complete second exercise for prescribed reps
4. Rest 60-120 seconds after both exercises
5. Repeat for prescribed rounds

### Best Practices
- Set up equipment beforehand
- Minimize transition time
- Maintain quality over speed
- Avoid pairing exercises that compromise each other

### Common Applications
- Time-efficient training
- Metabolic conditioning
- Accessory work
- Pre-exhaust techniques
- Volume accumulation

## VO2 Max Intervals Protocol

### Overview
High-intensity interval training designed to improve aerobic capacity and cardiovascular fitness.

### Standard Structure
- **Warm-up:** 800m easy jog + movement prep
- **Work Intervals:** 5 × 4 minutes at tempo/VO2 effort
- **Rest Intervals:** 2 minutes easy jog/walk between
- **Cool-down:** Easy movement

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Complete thorough warm-up including dynamic movements
2. Run at consistent tempo pace (hard but sustainable)
3. Keep moving during rest periods (active recovery)
4. Maintain same pace across all intervals
5. Focus on breathing rhythm and staying relaxed

### Intensity Guidelines
- Should feel challenging but repeatable
- Unable to hold conversation during work periods
- Heart rate 85-95% of max during intervals
- Breathing hard but controlled

### Adaptations
- Can be performed on bike, rower, or other equipment
- Adjust work:rest ratios based on fitness level
- Start with 3 intervals and progress to 5
- Not recommended more than 2x per week

## Complex Training Protocol

### Overview
Combining multiple exercises into a flowing sequence, typically Olympic lifts with strength movements.

### Example Complex (from SW7 Academy)
**Hang Clean + Front Squat + Push Press**
- 2 Hang Cleans
- 2 Front Squats
- 1 Push Press
- Perform 5 rounds with 90-180 sec rest

### Implementation
- Use same weight for entire complex
- Don't put bar down between exercises
- Focus on quality over speed
- Rest adequately between rounds
- Select weight based on weakest exercise

### Benefits
- Improved power development
- Enhanced coordination
- Time efficiency
- Metabolic conditioning
- Full-body training

## Wave Loading Protocol

### Overview
Systematic manipulation of sets and reps within a single session to potentiate the nervous system.

### Example Patterns

**Potentiation Wave (6-4-2)**
- Set 1: 6 reps @ 80%
- Set 2: 4 reps @ 85%
- Set 3: 2 reps @ 90%
- Repeat wave with slightly heavier weights

**Heavy Wave (5-3-1)**
- Set 1: 5 reps @ 85%
- Set 2: 3 reps @ 90%
- Set 3: 1 rep @ 95%
- Repeat wave

### Benefits
- Neural adaptation
- Strength peaking
- Allows heavier loading
- Psychological preparation for max efforts

## Circuit Training Protocol

### Overview
Sequential exercise performance with minimal rest between stations.

### Structure
- 3-5 exercises per circuit
- Minimal rest between exercises
- 60-120 seconds rest between rounds
- 3-5 total rounds

### Example Circuit (Midline Smash)
1. Plate Russian Twists - 10 each side
2. Hanging Knee Raises - 15 reps
3. Sprint Plank - 30 seconds
- Perform 3 rounds

### Best Practices
- Set up all stations beforehand
- Choose non-competing exercises
- Scale difficulty to maintain quality
- Track round times for progression
