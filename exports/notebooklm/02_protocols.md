## Rest-Pause Protocol
**Aliases:** Max, Rest-Pause, Cluster

### Overview
Intensity technique for breaking through plateaus and maximizing muscle fiber recruitment.

### Implementation
1. Perform reps to failure

3. Perform as many additional reps as possible
4. Optional: Repeat for additional mini-sets

### Best Practices
- Use on accessory movements, not main lifts
- Maintain strict form even when fatigued
- Stop if form deteriorates significantly
- Keep rest periods precise (20 seconds)

### Common Applications
- Final set intensification
- Breaking plateaus
- Time-efficient training
- Accessory work enhancement

- **Non-competing Superset:** Different muscle groups (legs/shoulders)

### Implementation
1. Complete first exercise for prescribed reps
2. Immediately transition to second exercise
3. Complete second exercise for prescribed reps
4. Rest 60-120 seconds after both exercises
5. Repeat for prescribed rounds

### Best Practices
- Set up equipment beforehand
- Minimize transition time
- Maintain quality over speed
- Avoid pairing exercises that compromise each other

### Common Applications
- Time-efficient training
- Metabolic conditioning
- Accessory work
- Pre-exhaust techniques

## VO2 Max Intervals Protocol

### Overview
High-intensity interval training designed to improve aerobic capacity and cardiovascular fitness.

### Implementation Guidelines
1. Complete thorough warm-up including dynamic movements
2. Run at consistent tempo pace (hard but sustainable)
3. Keep moving during rest periods (active recovery)
4. Maintain same pace across all intervals
5. Focus on breathing rhythm and staying relaxed

### Intensity Guidelines
- Should feel challenging but repeatable
- Unable to hold conversation during work periods
- Heart rate 85-95% of max during intervals
- Breathing hard but controlled

### Adaptations
- Can be performed on bike, rower, or other equipment
- Adjust work:rest ratios based on fitness level
- Start with 3 intervals and progress to 5
