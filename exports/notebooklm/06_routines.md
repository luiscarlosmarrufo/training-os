## Core Training Routine
**Duration:** 15-20 minutes
**Frequency:** 3x/week or daily (lighter)
**Philosophy:** Train CORE not just abs - focus on stability and anti-rotation

### Basic Core Circuit
1. **Lock clam** - 2×25 (glute activation)
2. **Front planks** - 2×30 sec (zero movement)
3. **Side planks** - 2×15 sec each (zero movement)
4. **Shoulder taps** - 20 reps (anti-rotation)
5. **Banded glute bridge** - 10×5 sec holds

### Advanced Core Circuit
1. **Weighted hanging knee raises** - 3×8-12
   - Dumbbell between feet
   - Control the descent
2. **Windshield wipers** - 3×10 each side
   - Lower back mobility
   - Oblique strength
3. **Side plank leg raises** - 3×10 each side
   - Obliques + glute medius

### Squat-Specific Core
Purpose: Improve squat through targeted core work
- Weighted hanging knee raises (hip flexor strength)
- Windshield wipers (obliques and lower back)
- Side plank with leg raise (lateral stability)

### Key Principles
- Zero movement in isometric holds
- Anti-rotation focus over flexion
- Include glute work (part of core system)
- Quality over quantity always

**Purpose:** Prepare body for running, prevent injury

### Movement Sequence

#### Lower Body Activation
1. **Knee pulls** - Knees to chest, alternating
2. **Quad pulls** - Heel to glute, opposite arm reaches up, calf raise
3. **Toe sweeps** - Dynamic hamstring stretch
4. **Frankensteins** - Touch foot with opposite hand

#### Hip Mobility
5. **Lunge with rotation** - Rotate toward front leg, step back
6. **Lateral lunges** - Step out to side, good stretch
7. **Deep squats** - Full range bodyweight

#### Hip Rotation
8. **Open gates** - Knee up and rotate outward

11. **Butt kickers** - Kick under hips (not back)
12. **Pogos** - Easy elastic bounce

### Important Note
Stiff connective tissue increases running economy - don't need excessive flexibility. This provides optimal mobility without overdoing it.
