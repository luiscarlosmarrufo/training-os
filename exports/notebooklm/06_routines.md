# Training OS - Routines Library

## Core Training Routine
**Duration:** 15-20 minutes
**Frequency:** 3x/week or daily (lighter)
**Philosophy:** Train CORE not just abs - focus on stability and anti-rotation

### Basic Core Circuit

2. **Front planks** - 2×30 sec (zero movement)
3. **Side planks** - 2×15 sec each (zero movement)
4. **Shoulder taps** - 20 reps (anti-rotation)
5. **Banded glute bridge** - 10×5 sec holds

### Advanced Core Circuit
1. **Weighted hanging knee raises** - 3×8-12

   - Control the descent
2. **Windshield wipers** - 3×10 each side
   - Lower back mobility
   - Oblique strength
3. **Side plank leg raises** - 3×10 each side
   - Obliques + glute medius

### Squat-Specific Core
Purpose: Improve squat through targeted core work
- Weighted hanging knee raises (hip flexor strength)
- Windshield wipers (obliques and lower back)
- Side plank with leg raise (lateral stability)

### Key Principles
- Zero movement in isometric holds
- Anti-rotation focus over flexion
- Include glute work (part of core system)

Stiff connective tissue increases running economy - don't need excessive flexibility. This provides optimal mobility without overdoing it.
