# Massage Gun Technique

## The Rule
Always work with venous and lymphatic drainage - **"toward the heart"**

## Application
- **Lower body:** Work from feet upward toward torso
- **Upper body:** Work from hands inward toward chest
- **Back:** Work from lower back upward

## Rationale
- Assists natural lymphatic drainage
- Improves venous return
- Reduces swelling and inflammation
- Enhances recovery efficiency

## Common Mistakes
- Working against drainage (away from heart)
- Excessive pressure
- Too long on one spot
- Using on bones or joints

## Optimal Protocol
- 30-60 seconds per muscle group
- Light to moderate pressure
- Move slowly along muscle
- Always toward the heart
- Post-workout or before bed
