# Boxing Strength Standards

## Minimum Strength Requirements

### The Standards
Before focusing on speed, power, or conditioning, achieve these minimums:

1. **Bench Press**
   - 3 rep max: 1.0-1.2× bodyweight

2. **Trap Bar Deadlift**
   - 3 rep max: 1.85-2.0× bodyweight

3. **Pull-Ups**
   - Max reps: 15 minimum

## Rationale
- Sufficient strength base required for power development
- Prevents injury from high-intensity training
- Creates foundation for sport-specific adaptations
- Once achieved, shift focus to speed/power/conditioning

## Programming After Minimums
Once standards are met:
- Maintain strength with 1-2 sessions/week
- Shift focus to:
  - Speed work (plyometrics, sprints)
  - Power development (Olympic lifts, medicine ball)
  - Sport-specific conditioning
  - Technical skill development

## Assessment Protocol
- Test every 8-12 weeks
- Use same conditions (time of day, warm-up)
- 3RM more reliable than 1RM for fighters
- Consider fight schedule when testing

## Notes
- These are MINIMUMS, not optimal levels
- Some fighters benefit from higher strength levels
- Adjust based on weight class and fighting style
- Strength maintenance crucial during camp
