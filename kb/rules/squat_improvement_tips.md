# 5 Tips to Improve Squats

## The 5 Key Points

### 1. Neutral Spine
Maintain natural spinal curves throughout the movement. No excessive arching or rounding.

### 2. Bring Elbows to the Front
Creates upper back tightness and better bar position. Helps maintain upright torso.

### 3. Think "Lat Pulldown"
Actively pull the bar into your traps. Creates upper back tightness and stability.

### 4. Think "Spread the Floor"
External rotation cue to activate glutes. Push feet apart without actually moving them. Critical for knee tracking and glute engagement.

### 5. Brace Core Every Rep
Take a breath, brace hard before descending. Prevents feeling weak and unstable. Reset between reps if needed.

## Implementation
- Practice each cue individually first
- Combine cues gradually
- Use lighter weights when learning
- Film yourself to check form

## Why These Matter
- **Neutral spine**: Injury prevention and force transfer
- **Elbows front**: Upper back stability
- **Lat pulldown**: Creates shelf for bar
- **Spread floor**: Glute activation and knee health
- **Core bracing**: Spinal protection and power transfer

## Notes
These cues apply to back squat primarily but concepts transfer to all squat variations.
