# Sprint Rest Formula

## Statement
**Rest time (minutes) = Sprint distance (yards) ÷ 10**

## Examples
- 10 yards = 1 minute rest
- 15 yards = 1.5 minutes rest
- 20 yards = 2 minutes rest
- 30 yards = 3 minutes rest
- 40 yards = 4 minutes rest

## Rationale
Proportional rest ensures adequate phosphocreatine replenishment for maintaining sprint quality across all distances.

## Notes
- Critical for maintaining sprint velocity
- Prevents excessive fatigue accumulation
- Allows for consistent power output
