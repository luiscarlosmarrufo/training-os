# Best Exercises for Muscle Growth

## Statement
The most effective exercises for building muscle mass are:

### Lower Body
1. **Squat** - Quad and glute development
2. **Bulgarian Split Squat** - Unilateral leg development
3. **Barbell Hip Thrust** - Glute focus
4. **Sled Push** - Quad dominance without eccentric

### Upper Body Push
5. **Dumbbell Bench Press** - Chest with greater ROM
6. **Dumbbell Shoulder Press** - Deltoid development
7. **Plate Press-Up** - Chest finisher

### Upper Body Pull
8. **Chin/Pull-Ups** - Lat and bicep mass
9. **Single-Arm Dumbbell Row** - Unilateral back development
10. **Prone Pull** - Mid-back thickness

## Rationale
These exercises optimize:
- Time under tension
- Muscle stretch and contraction
- Progressive overload potential
- Mind-muscle connection

## Notes
- Use variety of rep ranges (6-15)
- Focus on controlled eccentrics
- Progress through volume before intensity
