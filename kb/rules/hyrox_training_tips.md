# Hyrox Training Tips

## 100 Unbroken Wall Balls Protocol
To achieve 100 unbroken wall balls, focus on these exercises:

1. **Thrusters** - Build strength endurance
2. **Wall balls from floor** - No momentum, pure strength
3. **Push press with dumbbells** - Shoulder endurance
4. **Strict press (heavy barbell)** - Raw pressing strength

## Farmers Carry Sprint
- Sprinting farmers carry requires exceptional raw strength
- Progressive overload on grip and core stability essential
- Practice transitioning from walk to sprint with load

## Key Training Principles
- Build strength base first, then add endurance
- Practice specific movements under fatigue
- Train transitions between stations
- Focus on grip endurance for multiple stations

## Notes
- Machines are acceptable for building base strength
- Sport-specific practice must accompany strength work
- Recovery is critical with high training volume
