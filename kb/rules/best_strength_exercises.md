# Best Strength Exercises

## Statement
The most effective exercises for building raw strength are:

1. **Back Squat** - Lower body strength foundation
2. **Bench Press** - Upper body pushing strength
3. **Chins/Pull-Ups** - Upper body pulling strength
4. **Farmer's Carry** - Total body strength and stability
5. **Bulgarian Split Squat** - Unilateral lower body strength

## Rationale
These exercises allow for:
- Progressive overload over long timeframes
- High loading potential
- Multi-joint involvement
- Full-body tension and stability requirements

## Notes
- Focus on these movements for strength phases
- Allow adequate recovery between sessions
- Prioritize form over load initially
