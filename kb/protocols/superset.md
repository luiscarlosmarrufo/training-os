# Superset Protocol

## Steps
1. Perform first exercise for prescribed reps
2. Move immediately to second exercise
3. Complete second exercise for prescribed reps
4. Rest after both exercises complete
5. Repeat for prescribed number of rounds

## Types
- **Antagonist**: Opposing muscle groups (e.g., biceps/triceps)
- **Agonist**: Same muscle group (pre-exhaust or compound/isolation)
- **Non-competing**: Different muscle groups (e.g., legs/shoulders)

## Cues
- Minimize transition time between exercises
- Have equipment ready beforehand
- Maintain form quality throughout

## Common Applications
- Time-efficient training
- Metabolic conditioning
- Accessory work
- Pre-exhaust techniques

## Avoid
- Pairing exercises that compromise each other
- Using with heavy compound lifts
- Rushing through movements

## Notes
- Marked as "SS" in programs
- Rest periods typically 60-120 seconds after both exercises
- Common in accessory sections of programs
