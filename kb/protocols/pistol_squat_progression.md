# Pistol Squat Progression

## Overview
Progressive system to master the pistol squat through mobility work, strength building, and technical practice.

## Mobility Prerequisites

### Wall Squat Test
1. Back completely against wall (including heels)
2. Step forward, toes pointing slightly out
3. Feet slightly wider than shoulders
4. Descend with back against wall
5. Full depth without heels lifting
6. Must be able to complete before progressing

### Dorsiflexion Work
- Stand on elevated surface (box)
- Push dorsiflexion, forcing ankle mobility
- Hold stretched positions

## Technical Execution

### Weight Distribution
- Actively compress core throughout
- Reach arms forward during descent (counterbalance)
- Keep knee turned out like regular squat
- Push through heel

### Form Cues
1. Stand on one leg
2. Extend other leg forward, point toes ("pew pew" visualization)
3. Compress core actively
4. Reach forward with arms
5. Keep working knee turned out
6. Push through heel to return

## Progressive Training Steps

### Phase 1: Step-Ups
- Start with small elevation
- Focus on eccentric control
- Gradually extend non-working leg forward
- Goal: 5-8 reps each leg comfortably

### Phase 2: Eccentric Training
- Lower slowly (4-6 seconds)
- Perform at end of workout
- Use assistance to return to start

### Phase 3: Chair Pistol Squats
- Use chair/block for bottom position
- Allows stability to practice movement
- Let non-working foot hang lower (mobility gain)
- Progress by lowering chair height

### Phase 4: Assisted Full Range
- Use band, TRX, or pole for assistance
- Full range of motion
- Gradually reduce assistance

### Phase 5: Full Pistol Squat
- Unassisted movement
- Focus on control throughout

## Supplementary Work

### Core Compression
**Compact leg lifts:**
- Essential for maintaining position
- Can alternate legs if too difficult
- Builds necessary core strength

### Ankle Mobility
- Daily dorsiflexion stretches
- Calf stretches
- Ankle circles

## Programming
- Practice 2-3x per week
- 3-5 sets per session
- 5-8 reps per phase before progressing
- Allow 48 hours between sessions

## Common Errors
- Progressing too quickly
- Neglecting ankle mobility
- Allowing knee to cave inward
- Not using counterbalance
- Poor core control
