# Hip Mobility & Strengthening Protocol

## Overview
Comprehensive hip protocol for unlocking mobility, building strength, and improving athletic performance.

## Tight Hips Quick Fix

### Hip CARs (Controlled Articular Rotations)
- **Standing or Kneeling:** Perfect posture throughout
- Full circular hip motion
- 5 reps each direction, each leg

### Dynamic Mobility Sequence
1. **Butterfly Pulses** - 20-30 pulses
2. **Seated Hip Flexor Lifts** - Squeeze quad, hands forward on floor
3. **Single Leg Hip Rotation** - Foot anchored, drive knee out and back
4. **Deep Cossack Hip Internal Rotations** - Hold bottom position

## Unlock Hips Protocol

### Mobility Flow
1. **Hip CARs (Kneeling)** - Controlled circular motions
2. **Lunge Hip Rockers** - Rock forward and back in lunge
3. **Deep Hip Rockers** - Deep squat position rocking
4. **Heel Touches** - From quadruped position
5. **SLDL with Internal Rotation** - Foam roller inside knee, touch wall

## Hip Strengthening Workout

## Core & Hip Stability (Kettlebell)

### Offset Loading Series
1. **Suitcase Squat** - KB on one side only
2. **Offset Single-Leg RDL** - KB opposite side
3. **Split Stance Suitcase Squat** - Offset load

6. **Bird Dog KB Pull-Through** - Pull KB across body
7. **Plank Pull-Through** - Drag KB side to side

## Hip Mobility Checklist

### Essential Movements
1. **Jefferson Curls** - Start with elephant walks if painful
   - Also try straddle stance variation
2. **Seated Good Morning** - With barbell
3. **ATG Split Squats** - Unlock front splits without training them
4. **Loaded Butterfly** - Add weight for deeper stretch

## Hip Flexor Specific Work

### Full ROM Hip Flexors
**Note:** Avoid typical seated leg raises (limited ROM)

1. **Cable Knee Drives**
   - Long band attached far back
   - Full hip extension to flexion
   - Not miniband - need full range

2. **Hip Flexor Sit-Ups**
   - Foot anchored on KB
   - Full range of motion

### Hip Flexor Goals
- L-sit for 30 seconds effortlessly
- 30 knee raises without swinging
- Couch stretch with back to wall
- Incline pigeon feels like rest position

## Back Pain Prevention Goals

### Long-Term Standards
1. **Back Extension** to 20% bodyweight
2. **QL Extension** to 20% bodyweight
3. **30 Knee Raises** without swinging
4. **Hip Flexors** - L-sit 30 sec effortless
5. **Couch Stretch** - Back to wall
6. **Incline Pigeon** - Feels like rest position
