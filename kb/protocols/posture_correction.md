# Posture Correction Protocol

## Overview
Multiple approaches to correct forward head posture, neck hump, anterior pelvic tilt (Donald Duck butt), and general postural dysfunction.

## Basic Posture Routine
1. Wall angels - 10 reps
2. Lat stretch - 30 sec
3. Leg hugs - 30 sec
4. Cobra stretch - 30 sec

## Neck Hump/Forward Head Correction

### Method 1: Extension Restoration
1. **Prone head hangs** - Let chin fall forward, pull back and tuck, finish looking up
2. **Chin tuck with rotation** - Pull chin back, look left and right
3. Focus on slow, controlled movements
4. Stop if pain occurs

### Method 2: Neck Realignment
1. Chin tuck extensions - 10 slow reps (full ROM)
2. Side-lying neck lifts - 10 reps per side
3. Gravity chin tucks - 8-10 slow reps
4. Chin tuck with rotation - 8-10 reps
5. Cat-cow (quadruped spine flexion/extension) - 8-10 reps

### Method 3: Towel Support
- Place towel behind neck while lying down
- Perform small, controlled chin tucks
- Focus on small stabilizing muscles
- Not full ROM - targeted activation

## Anterior Pelvic Tilt Fix
1. **Shoulder dislocations** - Use band or stick, overhead to back
2. **Wall angels** - Core engaged, lower back flat, feet forward from wall
3. **Hip flexor stretch** - Kneel, engage core, tilt pelvis back, lean forward
4. **Glute bridges** - Progress to single leg

## Squat University Method

### Basic
- Prone position, forehead on floor
- Arms off ground (not touching)
- Overhead press motion (thumbs up)
- Hold 3 seconds, 10 reps
- Progress by adding weight

### Advanced
- Same prone position
- Full range arm circles
- Arms extended throughout
- Palms face down at shoulder level
- Flip palms up near hips
- Reverse on return

## Key Principles
- Consistency over intensity
- Stop if sharp pain occurs
- Focus on control and quality
- Address both flexibility and strength
- Target deep stabilizing muscles

## Programming
- Daily: Basic routine (5-10 minutes)
- 3x/week: Full protocol (15-20 minutes)
- Focus areas based on individual needs
