# Posture Correction Protocol

## Overview
Multiple approaches to correct forward head posture, neck hump, anterior pelvic tilt (Donald Duck butt), and general postural dysfunction.

## Basic Posture Routine
1. Wall angels - 10 reps
2. Lat stretch - 30 sec
3. Leg hugs - 30 sec
4. Cobra stretch - 30 sec

## Neck Hump/Forward Head Correction

### Method 1: Extension Restoration
1. **Prone head hangs** - Let chin fall forward, pull back and tuck, finish looking up
2. **Chin tuck with rotation** - Pull chin back, look left and right
3. Focus on slow, controlled movements
4. Stop if pain occurs

### Method 2: Neck Realignment
1. Chin tuck extensions - 10 slow reps (full ROM)
2. Side-lying neck lifts - 10 reps per side
3. Gravity chin tucks - 8-10 slow reps
4. Chin tuck with rotation - 8-10 reps
5. Cat-cow (quadruped spine flexion/extension) - 8-10 reps

### Method 3: Towel Support
- Place towel behind neck while lying down
- Perform small, controlled chin tucks
- Focus on small stabilizing muscles
- Not full ROM - targeted activation

## Anterior Pelvic Tilt Fix (Donald Duck Butt)
**Root Cause:** Weak glutes and tight hip flexors

### Method 1: Basic Protocol
1. **Shoulder dislocations** - Use band or stick, overhead to back
2. **Wall angels** - Core engaged, lower back flat, feet forward from wall
3. **Hip flexor stretch** - Kneel, engage core, tilt pelvis back, lean forward
4. **Glute bridges** - Progress to single leg

### Method 2: Machine Focus
1. **Hip thrust machine** - Heavy loading for glute strength
2. **Glute bridges** - High volume
3. **Couch stretch** - Deep hip flexor stretch

### Method 3: Foundation Approach
1. **Reverse plank bridges** - 10 reps for glute max
2. **Side-lying hip abduction** - 10 reps for glute medius
3. **Kneeling hip flexor stretch** - 30 sec each side (heel to glute)

## Squat University Method

### Basic
- Prone position, forehead on floor
- Arms off ground (not touching)
- Overhead press motion (thumbs up)
- Hold 3 seconds, 10 reps
- Progress by adding weight

### Advanced
- Same prone position
- Full range arm circles
- Arms extended throughout
- Palms face down at shoulder level
- Flip palms up near hips
- Reverse on return

## Key Principles
- Consistency over intensity
- Stop if sharp pain occurs
- Focus on control and quality
- Address both flexibility and strength
- Target deep stabilizing muscles

## Additional Posture Protocols

### Daily Quick Fixes (1 minute each)
1. **Ear hold** - Touch ears with hands, hold 1 minute (prevents hunchback)
2. **Collarbone kiss** - Touch collarbone, kiss ceiling opposite side, 1 minute (prevents double chin)
3. **Behind back clasp** - Cross hands behind, tilt head back, 1 minute (prevents rounded shoulders)

### Slouching Correction (5 minutes)
1. **Bench lean** - Diagonal lean against bench/wall
2. **Cobra extension** - Full spine extension
3. **Jellyfish arms** - Dynamic arm movements

### Band-Based Protocol
1. **Doorway stretch** - Both sides, 1 minute each
2. **Wall leans** - Diagonal facing up, 2-3 sets of 1 minute
3. **Band external rotation** - 3 second holds
4. **Face pulls** - Two phases: pull to face, then externally rotate
5. **Cable flies** - Pinch shoulder blades together

### Lordosis Correction
1. Stretch hip flexors
2. Lower back flexion exercises
3. Stretch abs
4. Stretch glutes

### Deep Cervical Flexor Strengthening
1. Chin tucks with sustained isometric holds
2. Stretch suboccipitals and SCM (head down/sideways)
3. Scapular retraction with foam roller
4. Include DB rows and wall angels
