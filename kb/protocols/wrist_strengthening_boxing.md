# Wrist Strengthening for Boxing

## Overview
Comprehensive wrist strengthening protocol for boxers and strikers to develop punching power and prevent wrist injuries.

## Complete Wrist Protocol (High Volume)

### Mat Work
1. **Palm Lifts (on knees)**
   - 4×30 sec, rest 30 sec
   - Kneel and lift palms off ground

2. **Closed Fist Deviation**
   - 3×45 sec, rest 30 sec
   - Knees and fists like plank position
   - Roll wrists forward and back ("hammer" motion)
   - Include both radial and slight ulnar deviation

3. **Hand-Hand-Fist-Fist**
   - 3×60 sec, rest 45 sec
   - Alternate between open hands and closed fists

### Grip Work
4. **Grip Trainer (Heavy)**
   - 4×20 reps, rest 45 sec
   - Adjustable grip trainer, heavy resistance
   - Full close and open

5. **Grip Trainer Holds**
   - 4×15 sec, rest 30 sec
   - Hold closed position

### Weighted Work
6. **DB Wrist Flexion (Palms Up)**
   - 4×20 reps, rest 30 sec
   - Forearm supported on bench

7. **DB Isometric Holds (Palms Down)**
   - 4×30 sec, rest 45 sec
   - Wrist extension position

8. **DB Wrist Supination**
   - 4×20 reps, rest 45 sec
   - Rotate from pronation to supination

## Explosive Punching Power Drills

### Band Work
1. **Band Ground & Pound**
   - Light resistance band with grip
   - Punch down explosively
   - Knees slightly flexed
   - 3×15-20 reps each arm

2. **Hugging Ball Rotations**
   - Medicine ball with band resistance
   - Explosive rotational movement
   - 3×10 each direction

### Isometric Work
**Punch Isometrics (with gloves)**
- Hold punch position against resistance
- Builds power generation capacity
- 3×10 sec holds per arm

## Supplementary Exercises

### Striking-Specific
- **Fist Push-Ups** - Wrist alignment and stability
- **Landmine One-Arm Push** - Explosive opening of legs
- **Medicine Ball Front Throw** - Wrist snap development

### Unique Drills (Advanced)
- **Kettlebell Towel Pistol Squat** (Nick Nilsson method)
  - Towel in rack for stability
  - KB on working side
  - Builds grip and wrist stability under load

## Programming Options

### Option 1: Full Protocol (45-60 min)
- Complete all exercises as written
- 2× per week
- For dedicated wrist development phase

### Option 2: Abbreviated (20-30 min)
- Pick 4-5 exercises
- 3× per week
- Maintenance or pre-fight prep

### Option 3: Pre-Training Activation (10 min)
- Palm lifts - 2×20 sec
- Fist deviations - 2×30 sec
- Wrist flexion/extension - 2×15 reps
- Before boxing/striking sessions

## Important Notes
- High volume approach (adjust based on recovery)
- Can perform barefoot for better ground connection
- Stop if sharp pain occurs
- Ice after intense sessions
- Progress load gradually

## Performance Standards
- Grip trainer: Work up to bodyweight equivalent
- Wrist flexion: 25% bodyweight for reps
- Hold positions: 60+ seconds
- Fist push-ups: 50+ consecutive

## Key Points
- Wrist strength directly impacts punching power
- Isometric holds build tendon resilience
- Explosive drills transfer to striking
- Consistency more important than intensity
- Combine with proper punching technique
