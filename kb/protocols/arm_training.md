# Arm Training Protocol

## Overview
Science-based approach to building bigger arms, targeting all heads of triceps, biceps, and forearms.

## Key Principles

### Triceps (70% of Arm Mass)
- **Lateral & Medial Heads:** Hit easily with dips, close-grip bench, JM press, pushdowns
- **Long Head (Majority of Size):** Requires overhead position for full stretch

### Biceps
- **Long Head vs Short Head:** Cannot isolate, but can emphasize
- **Rule:** Elbow behind torso = long head emphasis, Elbow in front = short head emphasis

### Brachialis
- Not targeted well with hammer curls
- Best hit with reverse curls

## Workout Structure

### Triceps (4-5 sets total per session)

#### Long Head Focus
**Single-Arm Cable Overhead Extension**
- Hold something for stability with free hand
- Elbow stays in place throughout
- All sets to failure
- 2 sets each arm

#### Lateral/Medial Heads
**Choose one:**
- Close-grip bench press
- JM press
- Tricep pushdowns
- Dips
- 2-3 sets

### Biceps (4-5 sets total per session)

#### Long Head Emphasis
**Bison Cable Curl**
- Elbow behind torso
- Elbow stays in place
- 2 sets each arm

#### Short Head Emphasis
**Single-Arm DB Hammer Preacher Curl**
- No momentum
- Controlled throughout
- 1 set per arm

#### Alternative: Reverse Curl
- Better than hammer for brachialis
- Also hits brachioradialis

### Forearms (4-5 sets total per session)

#### Three Main Areas

1. **Forearm Flexors**
   - Cable on top - wrist flexion
   - Elbow stays in same position
   - 2 sets

2. **Forearm Extensors**
   - Cable at bottom - wrist extension
   - Elbow position maintained
   - 2 sets

3. **Brachioradialis**
   - Reverse curls (can replace hammer curls)
   - 2 sets

## Volume & Frequency

### Triceps & Biceps
- **Frequency:** 2× per week
- **Sets per exercise:** 2 sets (1 set if unilateral)
- **Total per session:** 4-5 sets triceps, 4-5 sets biceps
- **Intensity:** To failure or near failure

### Forearms
- **Frequency:** 2-3× per week (recover quickly)
- **Sets:** 2 per exercise
- **Total per session:** 4-5 sets
- **Intensity:** To failure

## Programming Example

### Session A (Monday)
1. Single-arm cable overhead extension - 2 sets each
2. Close-grip bench press - 3 sets
3. Bison cable curl - 2 sets each
4. DB hammer preacher curl - 1 set each
5. Wrist flexion - 2 sets
6. Reverse curls - 2 sets

### Session B (Thursday)
1. Single-arm cable overhead extension - 2 sets each
2. Tricep pushdowns - 3 sets
3. Bison cable curl - 2 sets each
4. Reverse curls - 2 sets
5. Wrist extension - 2 sets
6. Wrist flexion - 2 sets

## Key Points
- Long head of triceps is crucial for size
- Don't neglect brachialis and forearms
- Maintain strict form on all exercises
- Elbow position determines muscle emphasis
- All sets to failure or 0-1 RIR
- Recovery is fast for arms - can train 2-3× weekly
