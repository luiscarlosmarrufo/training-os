# Rest-Pause Protocol

## Steps
1. Perform reps to failure
2. Rest 20 seconds
3. Perform as many additional reps as possible
4. Optional: repeat for additional mini-sets

## Cues
- Use proper form even when fatigued
- Keep rest periods strict (20 seconds)
- Stop if form breaks down significantly

## Common Applications
- Final set intensification
- Breaking through plateaus
- Time-efficient training

## Avoid
- Using on technically complex movements
- Performing when already fatigued
- Extending rest beyond prescribed time

## Notes
- Marked as "Max" in Dylan Shannon program
- Excellent for accessory work
- Not recommended for main compound lifts
