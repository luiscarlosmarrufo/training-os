# Shin Splints Prevention Protocol

## Overview
Comprehensive protocol for preventing and treating shin splints (periostitis/anterior tibialis syndrome). Addresses root causes including weak feet, collapsed arches, anterior tibialis weakness, and force production/absorption imbalance.

## Key Principle
Shin splints occur when force producing > force your lower leg can absorb. Focus on single-leg force production and absorption capacity.

## Quick Relief Method
- Enter plantar flexion position (kneeling)
- Shift weight back into ankles
- Stretches anterior tibialis muscle and tendon
- Hold 30-60 seconds

## Warmup Protocol (2 weeks cure)
1. Heel walks - 2×20-30 steps
2. Toe taps - 2×20-30 steps
3. Pogo jumps - 2×20-30 jumps

## Strengthening Protocol

### Method 1: Resistance Training
1. Band resistance dorsiflexion raises
2. Standing anterior tibialis raises (further from wall = harder)
3. Band resistance ankle inversion (key for rehab)
4. Arch lifts/short foot exercise - maintain toe and heel contact, lift arch only

### Method 2: Foot Strength Focus
1. Arch builders - 25 reps/side
2. Isometric 5th ray holds - 20×3 sec holds/side (single leg toe stand)
3. Tib turns - 30 reps/side
4. T tucks (toe stretches) - 60s/side

### Method 3: Progressive Loading
1. Wall tibialis raises - 15-20 reps
2. Slanted wall tibialis raises (increased ROM)
3. Single-leg seated KB/banded tib raises

### Method 4: Weighted Protocol
1. Tib bar raises - 20% bodyweight, 3-4 sets AMRAP
2. Wobble board inversion/eversion - 3-4 sets AMRAP
3. Full range single leg calf raises - 3-4 sets AMRAP

### Method 5: Bodyweight Circuit (4 sets each)
1. Single leg calf raises - 10 reps each (4 sec eccentric)
2. Lunge hold calf raises - 10 reps each side
3. Wall lean toe raises - 15-20 reps (further = harder)

### Method 6: Advanced Force Production (Barefoot Recommended)
1. Single leg weighted calf raises - Don't let foot roll out, pressure on big toe
2. Tiptoe farmer's carry - Forward, backward, bent knee variations
3. Bulgarian calf raises
4. Fast single leg bridge to wall (tiptoe throughout)
5. Single leg pogos - Other leg on bench
6. Stagger stance pogos (boxing/muay thai guard)
7. Lateral hop ups
8. Tuck jumps

### Method 7: Foot Strengthening with Bands
1. Big toe pumps with resistance bands - 20×2
2. Ankle eversions (band) - 20×2
3. Heel walks - 40 steps total
4. Tib raise to calf raise - 3×12 (band between big toes)
5. Lateral toe steps (band between toes) - 3×20 alternating

## Soleus Training (Handles 8× Bodyweight)
Critical shock absorber - if weak, causes arch collapse and shin splints:
1. Ball squeeze bent knee calf raises (ball between heels) - shoes off
2. Weighted smith/bar calf raises
3. Single leg bent knee calf raises with KB

## Running Form Correction
- Foot must land directly below center of gravity
- Heel striking far in front of center creates excess shock
- Practice midfoot landing under hips
- Consider using toe spreaders for foot health

## Performance Standards
- KB tib raises: Work up to 15% bodyweight
- Tib bar: Work up to 20% bodyweight
- Single leg force production matches absorption capacity

## Key Points
- Focus on controlled movements
- Emphasize eccentric portion
- Progress distance from wall for increased difficulty
- Address both strength and mobility
- Target collapsed arches and weak feet as root cause
- Train barefoot when possible for better foot strength
- Ice/cold plunge after intense sessions
- Foam roll and stretch after training

## Frequency
- Prevention: 1-2 sessions per week
- Active rehab: 2-3 sessions per week
- Maintenance: 1 session per week
