# Knee Pain Rehabilitation Protocol

## Overview
Comprehensive protocol for addressing various types of knee pain including IT band syndrome (outside knee), medial knee pain (inside knee), and general knee dysfunction.

## IT Band Syndrome (Outside Knee Pain)

### Pre-Run Activation
- Band around knees at knee level
- Lateral walks maintaining glute activation
- 15 reps each direction - MUST feel glutes

### Strengthening Protocol
1. **Side-lying hip abduction (banded)** - 8-12 reps
2. **Wall sit with banded hip abduction** - 20-30 sec holds × 3 (push knees out)
3. **Pelvic hip drop** - 8-12 reps each side
4. **Side-lying TFL abduction** - Leg slightly forward, toe down, heel up

### Key Note
When TFL is weak, it causes pain on outside of knee. TFL connects to knee via IT band.

## Medial Knee Pain (Inside Knee)

### Rehabilitation Exercises
1. **Spider-man crawl** - Prone hip internal rotation, knee bent 90°, move feet outward
2. **Ball squeeze bridge** - Back on floor, knees bent, squeeze ball/roller between thighs
3. **Side-lying adduction** - Dragon pistol squat position on floor, lift extended leg
4. **Copenhagen plank** - Ultimate progression for inner thigh/hamstring strength

### Activation Sequence
1. Foam roller between thighs during bridges
2. Simultaneous hamstring and adductor strengthening
3. Progress to Copenhagen plank when ready

## General Knee Pain - Weekly Routine (20 min/day)

### Day 1: Foundation
- Seated wall calf raises (knees bent, back against wall)
- Banded TKEs (terminal knee extensions) for tracking
- Weighted glute bridges

### Day 2: Tendon Strength
- Backward sled walking
- Slant board step downs
- Spanish squats (band behind knees)

### Day 3: Lower Leg Focus
- Wall tibialis raises
- Single leg weighted calf raises
- KOT (knees over toes) calf raises - bent knee, both legs

### Day 4: Hip Focus
- Banded lateral walks
- Side-lying leg raises (banded)
- Banded hip flexor raises

### Day 5: Full Range Strength
- ATG split squats
- Wall sit calf raises
- Tibialis raises

## Top Exercises for Knee Pain
1. Single leg glute bridges
2. Banded side steps
3. Sled pulls/backward treadmill walking
4. Poliquin step-ups
5. Bulgarian split squats
6. ATG split squats
7. Nordic hamstring curls
8. Seated calf raises
9. Copenhagen holds

## Mobility Work for Knees
- Knee over toe ankle rocks
- Calf stretches (downward dog)
- Cossack squats WITH hip rotation

## Pre-Workout Knee Activation
1. Foam roll quads and hips - 1 minute
2. Elevated world's greatest stretch
3. Spanish squats (banded) - 3×45 sec OR wall sits if too difficult
4. Internal rotation biased clams

## Advanced Protocol (Pelvic Hitch Method)
Purpose: Update hip "software" for knee compatibility
1. TFL strengthening (side-lying abduction variations)
2. Pelvic hitch exercise connecting TFL to knee
3. Foam roller thigh squeezes for hamstring/adductor integration
4. Progress to Copenhagen plank

## Important Notes
- Knee popping/cracking often indicates weakness in stabilizing muscles
- Address both hip and ankle mobility for knee health
- Progressive loading is key - start bodyweight, add resistance gradually
- If pain persists, consult healthcare provider

## Frequency Guidelines
- Acute pain: Daily gentle mobility
- Rehabilitation: 5-6 days/week rotating focus areas
- Maintenance: 3 days/week
- Pre-activity: Always activate before training
