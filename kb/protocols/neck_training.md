# Neck Training Protocol

## Overview
Safe neck strengthening protocol avoiding dangerous bridging exercises. Focus on controlled, weighted movements with proper breathing and positioning.

## Andrew Huberman Method

### Setup
- Lie on bench, stabilize with one arm
- Use 5-10 lb plate wrapped in towel (prevents imprint)
- Keep tongue on roof of mouth
- Keep jaw shut
- Nasal breathing only

### Exercises

#### Lateral Flexion (each side)
- Start: head neutral (straight up while on side)
- Move: 30-45 degrees only
- Reps: 10-25
- Sets: 3 each side

#### Extension
- Position: Lying prone (on stomach)
- Place plate on back of head
- Straight back extension (not pinching/wrenching)
- Avoid excessive range

#### "Kiss the Sky" (Fighters' technique)
- Look up with controlled extension
- Targets deeper neck muscles
- Use bodyweight only

### Important Notes
- Avoid torsion/rotation with weight
- Avoid excessive forward flexion work
- Start very light (5-10 lbs)
- Progress slowly

## Aesthetic Neck Building

### Basic Protocol
1. **Neck curls** - Weight on forehead
2. **Neck extensions** - Weight on back of head

### Programming
- Sets: 1-2 per exercise (delicate area)
- Reps: Few (5-8)
- Load: Heavy relative to capacity
- Frequency: 2x per week maximum

## Safety Guidelines
- **Never** perform weighted bridges
- Keep range of motion conservative (30-45 degrees)
- Always wrap plates in towel
- Maintain nasal breathing
- Keep tongue on roof of mouth
- Stop immediately if dizzy or sharp pain
- Allow 72 hours between sessions

## Progression
1. Start with bodyweight movements
2. Add 5 lb plate after 2 weeks
3. Increase by 2.5-5 lbs every 2-3 weeks
4. Maximum working weight: 25-35 lbs for most

## Common Mistakes
- Using too much weight too soon
- Excessive range of motion
- Training neck too frequently
- Using jerky movements
- Holding breath
- Ignoring pain signals
