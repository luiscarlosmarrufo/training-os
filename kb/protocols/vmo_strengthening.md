# VMO Strengthening Protocol

## Overview
Targeted protocol for developing the vastus medialis oblique (VMO), the teardrop-shaped muscle above the knee crucial for knee stability and tracking.

## Primary Exercises

### 1. Sled Work
- Forward sled drags
- Backward sled drags
- Focus on terminal knee extension
- High volume, moderate load

### 2. Elevated Heel Step-Ups
**Setup:**
- Heel elevated on plate or wedge
- Toe pointed slightly out
- Knee tracks slightly inward (controlled)

**Execution:**
- Slow, controlled movement
- Focus on mind-muscle connection
- Full terminal extension at top

### 3. Heels-Elevated Squats
**Progression:**
1. **Phase 1: Mind-Muscle Connection**
   - Bodyweight only
   - Very slow tempo (3-1-3)
   - Focus on feeling VMO engagement

2. **Phase 2: Volume**
   - High reps to "lock in" connection
   - 15-25 reps per set
   - Maintain constant tension

3. **Phase 3: Loading**
   - Add weight gradually
   - Maintain VMO focus
   - 8-12 rep range

## Programming

### Option 1: Dedicated VMO Day
1. Sled drags - 5×40 yards
2. Elevated heel step-ups - 3×12 each leg
3. Heels-elevated squats - 4×15-20

### Option 2: Pre-Activation
- Before leg training
- 2 sets heel-elevated squats
- 15-20 reps, bodyweight
- Creates better VMO recruitment

### Option 3: Finisher
- End of leg workout
- High rep heel-elevated squats
- 2-3 sets of 20-30 reps
- Constant tension technique

## Key Technical Points
- Terminal knee extension crucial
- Slight internal knee tracking acceptable
- Maintain constant tension
- Never lock out completely (keep tension)
- Focus on squeezing VMO at top

## Common Mistakes
- Moving too fast
- Losing mind-muscle connection
- Excessive internal knee rotation
- Using momentum
- Not achieving terminal extension

## Progression Timeline
- Weeks 1-2: Establish mind-muscle connection
- Weeks 3-4: Increase volume
- Weeks 5-6: Add light resistance
- Weeks 7+: Progressive overload

## Notes
- VMO responds well to high frequency
- Can be trained 3-4x per week
- Critical for knee health and stability
- Weak VMO often contributes to knee pain
