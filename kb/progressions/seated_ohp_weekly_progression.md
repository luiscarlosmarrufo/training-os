# Seated OHP Weekly Progression

## Pattern
- **Week 1:** 3×8
- **Week 2:** 4×8
- **Week 3:** 4×10
- **Week 4:** 4×12

## Implementation
- Choose load that keeps reps clean
- Small weight increases week to week if possible
- Focus on form over load

## Notes
- Volume-based progression
- Builds work capacity in vertical pressing
- Can restart cycle with slightly heavier weight
