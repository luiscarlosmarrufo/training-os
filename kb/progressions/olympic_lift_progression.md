# Olympic Lift Progression

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)
**Block Clean - 4×3**
- Focus on technique from blocks
- Moderate weight
- Consistent speed

## Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)
**Clean Wave: 3/3/2/2/1**
- Increase weight as reps decrease
- Focus on speed and crisp reps
- This is a wave within single session, not straight sets

## Implementation
- Start conservative with weight selection
- Prioritize bar speed over load
- Rest 2-3 minutes between sets

## Notes
- Progresses from easier block position to full cleans
- Wave loading in phase 2 allows for neural adaptation
- Designed to peak power output over 8 weeks
