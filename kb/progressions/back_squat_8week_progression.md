## Implementation
### Phase 1
- Traditional straight sets
- Progressive overload via intensity and volume

### Phase 2-3
- Two waves per session
- Build weight within each wave
- Second wave can be slightly heavier than first

## Notes
- Three distinct training phases
- Progresses from volume to intensity focus
- Wave loading in later phases for neural adaptation
- Designed for strength peaking
