# Wall Angels

## Description
Shoulder and scapular mobility exercise performed against a wall. Excellent for improving posture and shoulder health.

## Setup
1. Stand with back against wall
2. Feet slightly forward from wall
3. Lower back flat against wall (engage core)
4. Head, upper back, and glutes touching wall

## Execution
1. Start with arms at 90 degrees (goal post position)
2. Slowly raise arms overhead (like making snow angel)
3. Keep arms and back of hands against wall throughout
4. Lower back to start position
5. Maintain contact points throughout

## Key Cues
- Keep lower back flat (no arching)
- Maintain all contact points with wall
- Move slowly and controlled
- Don't force range if losing contact
- Breathe normally throughout

## Common Errors
- Arching lower back off wall
- Arms coming forward off wall
- Using momentum
- Forcing range beyond mobility

## Progressions
1. **Partial range** - Work within comfortable range
2. **Full range** - Arms fully overhead
3. **Weighted** - Hold light dumbbells (1-3 lbs)
4. **Tempo** - Slow eccentric/concentric

## Programming
- Daily: 10-15 reps for posture
- Pre-workout: 2×10 as activation
- Rehab: 3×15-20 slow and controlled

## Notes
- Diagnostic tool for shoulder mobility
- If can't maintain wall contact, indicates restrictions
- Regular practice improves posture significantly
