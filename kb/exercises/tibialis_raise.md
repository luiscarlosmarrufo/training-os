# Tibialis Raise

## Description
Dorsiflexion exercise targeting the tibialis anterior muscle. Essential for shin splint prevention and ankle health.

## Variations

### Wall Tibialis Raise
- Stand with back against wall
- Heels on ground, lift toes up
- Further from wall = harder

### Slanted Wall Tibialis Raise
- Same as wall version but on incline
- Increased range of motion

### Seated Banded/KB Tibialis Raise
- Seated position
- Band or kettlebell for resistance
- Can perform single leg

### Tib Bar Raise
- Using specialized tib bar
- Start with 20% bodyweight
- Full range of motion

## Key Cues
- Control the movement
- Full dorsiflexion at top
- Slow eccentric
- Keep heels planted
- Don't use momentum

## Common Progressions
- Distance from wall (bodyweight)
- Add resistance (band/weight)
- Single leg variations
- Increased ROM (slanted surface)

## Notes
- Critical for shin splint prevention
- Often neglected in training
- High frequency tolerance (can train daily if needed)
- Start conservative with loading
