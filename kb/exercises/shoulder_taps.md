# Shoulder Taps

## Description
Anti-rotation core exercise performed in high plank position. Challenges stability while removing one point of contact.

## Setup
1. Start in high plank position
2. Hands under shoulders
3. Feet slightly wider than hip-width
4. Neutral spine, engaged core

## Execution
1. Shift weight slightly to one side
2. Lift opposite hand to tap same-side shoulder
3. Return hand to ground with control
4. Alternate sides
5. Minimize hip rotation throughout

## Key Cues
- **Zero torso movement** ideal
- Keep hips square to ground
- Wider feet = easier balance
- Control the tempo
- Breathe steadily
- Engage core before each tap

## Progressions
1. **Knees down** - Beginner modification
2. **Standard** - High plank position
3. **Feet together** - Increased difficulty
4. **Weighted vest** - Added resistance
5. **Tempo** - Slow 2-3 second taps

## Common Errors
- Excessive hip rotation
- Rushing the movement
- Holding breath
- Sagging hips
- Head dropping

## Programming
- Beginner: 3×10 total (5 each side)
- Intermediate: 3×20 total
- Advanced: 3×30+ or timed sets

## Notes
- Excellent for anti-rotation training
- Builds shoulder stability
- Can be used in circuits or as standalone
- Quality over speed always
