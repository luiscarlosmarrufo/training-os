# Dynamic Running Warmup

## Overview
5-minute comprehensive warmup routine to prepare the body for running. Perform 15 reps or 30 seconds of each movement.

## Movement Sequence

### Lower Body Activation
1. **Knee pulls** - Knees to chest, alternating
2. **Quad pulls** - Pull heel to glute with one hand, reach for sky with other, add calf raise
3. **Toe sweeps** - Dynamic hamstring stretch
4. **Frankensteins** - Touch foot with opposite hand, straight leg

### Hip Mobility
5. **Lunge with rotation** - Rotate upper body toward front leg, return stepping back
6. **Lateral lunges** - Step out to side, good stretch, switch
7. **Deep squats** - Full range bodyweight squats

### Hip Rotation
8. **Open gates** - Bring knee up and rotate outward
9. **Close gates** - Bring knee from outside to inside, rotate body with it

### Running Preparation
10. **High knees** - Use arms and legs together, proper running form
11. **Butt kickers** - Kick underneath hips (not way back)
12. **Pogos** - Nice and easy bounce, elastic rebound

## Key Points
- Start gentle, increase intensity gradually
- Focus on full range of motion
- Maintain good posture throughout
- Don't rush - quality over speed
- Should feel warm and loose after completion

## Important Note
Stiff connective tissue actually increases running economy - you don't need excessive flexibility. This warmup provides optimal mobility without overdoing it.

## When to Use
- Before any run (easy, tempo, intervals)
- Before races
- Before track workouts
- Can modify for treadmill (stationary versions)
