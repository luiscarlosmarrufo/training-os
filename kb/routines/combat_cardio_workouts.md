# Combat Sports Cardio Workouts

## Overview
Four distinct cardio protocols targeting different energy systems for combat sports performance (Coach Tarun method).

## 1. Max Power (Creatine Phosphate System)

### Workout Structure
- **Work:** 10 seconds all-out sprint
- **Rest:** 50 seconds
- **Rounds:** 8-10
- **Total Time:** 8-10 minutes

### Suggested Equipment
- Assault bike (preferred)
- Assault runner
- Sprint track

### Purpose
- Improves maximal power output
- Develops power endurance
- Mimics explosive combinations in fighting

### Programming
- 1-2× per week
- Not on consecutive days
- Before technical training if same day

---

## 2. Anaerobic Capacity (Glycolytic System)

### Workout Structure
- **Work:** 15 seconds hard effort
- **Rest:** 45 seconds
- **Rounds:** 6 rounds
- **Recovery:** 3 minutes between blocks
- **Repeat:** 3-4 total blocks
- **Total Time:** 20-30 minutes

### Suggested Equipment
- Assault bike
- Rower
- Ski erg

### Purpose
- Builds lactate tolerance
- Improves anaerobic capacity
- Simulates round intensity

### Programming
- 2× per week
- Allow 48-72 hours between sessions
- Pairs well with technical work

---

## 3. Endurance Engine (Oxidative System)

### Workout Structure
- **Work:** 2 minutes moderate pace
- **Recovery:** 1 minute easy
- **Duration:** 20-30 minutes continuous
- **Total Time:** 20-30 minutes

### Suggested Equipment
- Treadmill
- Rower
- Stationary bike
- Assault bike

### Purpose
- Enhances aerobic endurance
- Improves cardiovascular efficiency
- Builds base conditioning

### Programming
- 2-3× per week
- Can do on consecutive days
- Good for active recovery

---

## 4. HIIT/Tabata (High-Intensity Interval Training)

### Workout Structure
- **Work:** 20 seconds max effort
- **Rest:** 10 seconds
- **Rounds:** 8-10
- **Total Time:** 4-5 minutes

### Suggested Equipment
- Sprints
- Assault bike
- Assault runner
- Ski erg

### Purpose
- Improves VO2 max
- Boosts metabolic conditioning
- Mental toughness development

### Programming
- 1-2× per week
- Extremely taxing - allow recovery
- Great finisher after skills training

---

## Additional Combat-Specific Protocols

### Spinning Bike Resistance (Arman Tsarukyan Method)
- Progressive resistance increases
- Builds lactic acid tolerance
- MMA-specific endurance
- 20-30 minutes with varying resistance

### Curved Treadmill Sprints
- Self-powered treadmill
- More realistic sprint mechanics
- 10×30 seconds with 90 seconds rest

### Hyrox-Style Circuit (20 minutes)
1. Bike 1km
2. Walking lunges 30m
3. Burpee to plate ×5
- Repeat continuously for time

---

## Weekly Programming Examples

### Fighter Camp (6 weeks out)
**Monday:** Max Power
**Tuesday:** Endurance Engine
**Wednesday:** Technical work only
**Thursday:** Anaerobic Capacity
**Friday:** HIIT/Tabata
**Saturday:** Sparring + Endurance Engine
**Sunday:** Rest

### Maintenance Phase
**Monday:** Anaerobic Capacity
**Wednesday:** Endurance Engine
**Friday:** Max Power or HIIT

### Strength Focus Phase
**Tuesday:** Endurance Engine (low intensity)
**Thursday:** Max Power (reduced volume)
**Saturday:** HIIT (1 round only)

---

## Important Notes

### Intensity Guidelines
- Max Power: 100% effort
- Anaerobic: 85-90% effort
- Endurance: 65-75% effort
- HIIT: 95-100% effort

### Recovery Requirements
- Max Power: 24-48 hours
- Anaerobic: 48-72 hours
- Endurance: 12-24 hours
- HIIT: 48 hours

### Monitoring
- Track power output/distance
- Note perceived exertion
- Monitor resting heart rate
- Adjust based on performance

---

## Key Points
- Energy system specificity matters
- Don't neglect aerobic base
- Recovery is part of training
- Match cardio to fight demands
- Quality over quantity
- Progressive overload applies to conditioning

## Performance Standards
- Max Power: Maintain 90%+ output all rounds
- Anaerobic: <20% power drop-off
- Endurance: Consistent pace throughout
- HIIT: Complete all rounds at target intensity
