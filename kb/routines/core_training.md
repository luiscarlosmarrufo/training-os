# Core Training Routine

## Philosophy
Train CORE not just abs - focus on stability, anti-rotation, and functional strength.

## Basic Core Circuit

### Activation
1. **Lock clam** - 2×25 reps (feel the glute activation)

### Stability Work
2. **Front planks** - 2×30 sec (zero torso movement)
3. **Side planks** - 2×15 sec each side (zero torso movement)
4. **Shoulder taps** - 20 reps (anti-rotation focus)

### Integration
5. **Banded glute bridge** - 10×5 sec isometric holds
   - Band between knees
   - Focus on glute-core connection

## Advanced Core Circuit

### Hip Flexor Strength
1. **Hanging knee raises** - with dumbbell between feet
   - Strong hip flexors = controlled descent
   - 3×8-12 reps

### Rotational Strength
2. **Windshield wipers** - 3×10 each side
   - Loosens lower back
   - Strengthens obliques

### Lateral Stability
3. **Side plank leg raises** - 3×10 each side
   - Works obliques and glute medius simultaneously

## Squat-Specific Core (3 accessories)

Purpose: Stronger back squat through core development

1. **Weighted hanging knee raises**
   - Dumbbell between feet
   - Control the descent

2. **Windshield wipers**
   - Lower back mobility
   - Oblique strength

3. **Side plank with leg raise**
   - Obliques + glute medius
   - Unilateral stability

## Key Principles
- **Zero movement** in isometric holds
- Anti-rotation focus over flexion
- Include glute work (part of core system)
- Progress holds before adding movement
- Quality over quantity always

## Programming Options

### Option 1: Daily Practice
- 5-10 minutes
- Basic circuit only
- Focus on perfect form

### Option 2: 3x/Week Strength
- 15-20 minutes
- Full advanced circuit
- Progressive overload

### Option 3: Pre-Squat Activation
- 10 minutes before leg day
- Focus on stability exercises
- Lighter intensity

## Common Errors
- Moving during "zero movement" holds
- Using momentum
- Neglecting breathing
- Training only rectus abdominis
- Ignoring glute-core connection
