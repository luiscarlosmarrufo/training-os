# Combat Sports Lifting Program

## Philosophy
Science-based approach to getting jacked and strong for combat sports. Balances strength development with sport-specific training demands.

## Key Programming Parameters

### Training Split Options
- **3-Day:** Full Body
- **4-Day:** Upper/Lower Split

### Frequency
- All muscle groups and movement patterns: 2-3× per week
- Compound movements cover multiple muscles simultaneously

### Intensity & Volume
- **Rep Range:** 4-8 (5-10 acceptable)
- **Intensity:** 0-1 RIR (Reps in Reserve)
- **Weekly Volume per Muscle:** 10-12 sets
- **Session Volume:** ~12 total effective sets
- **Per Muscle per Session:**
  - 4-6 sets @ 2×/week frequency
  - ~3 sets @ 3×/week frequency

### Rest & Recovery
- **Rest Between Sets:** 3 minutes minimum
- **No intensifiers** (drop sets, rest-pause, etc.)
- Machines are acceptable - "functional" isn't always better

### Exercise Order
Most prioritized muscles go first in session

## Combat Sports Specific Notes

### Lower Body Power (Spanish Translation Note)
"Fuerza del tren inferior y test de salto directamente correlacionada con la fuerza de los golpes"
- Lower body strength and jump tests directly correlate with punching power
- Heavy squats ARE necessary for combat sports

### MMA-Specific Exercises
- **Towel pull-ups** (bicep grip) - Grip strength for grappling
- **Weighted push-ups** - Plates on back
- **Arnold presses** - Explosive from hang position to press
- **Medicine ball ground to overhead** - Power development
- **Pull-up to muscle-up** - Finish sets with muscle-up attempt

### Conditioning Integration
- **Bike intervals** - Resistance work for lactic acid tolerance
- Important: Program must include hip hinge movement every leg day
- Balance heavy lifting with sport practice

## Key Principles
1. Strength is foundation for power
2. Don't sacrifice form for weight
3. Recovery is critical with sport training
4. Adjust volume based on competition schedule
5. Machines are fine - effectiveness over "functional"

## Progression
- Add 2.5-5 lbs when completing all reps at 0 RIR
- Deload every 4th week if needed
- Prioritize consistency over intensity
- Track all lifts for progressive overload
